## Task 1: Introduction

- Passive Reconnaissance
  - Involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target.
  - Examples: searching public records, websites, or social media.
  - Goal: collect data quietly, without alerting the target.
- Active Reconnaissance
  - Involves direct engagement with the target system or network.
  - Tools used:
    - **Web browser**: to explore and collect details about the target.
    - **Ping**: checks if a host is reachable and measures response time.
    - **Traceroute**: maps the path packets take to reach the target.
    - **Telnet**: tests connectivity and interacts with services on specific ports.
    - **Netcat (nc)**: versatile tool for probing services, sending data, or opening connections.

### what is Active Reconnaissance?
Active reconnaissance means making direct contact with the target to gather information.
- Methods:
  - Human interaction → phone calls, visits, or social engineering tactics.
  - Technical interaction → connecting to systems (e.g., visiting websites, probing firewalls, checking open ports like SSH)

- Similar to closely inspecting locks and windows on a house — you’re directly testing defenses.

> Active reconnaissance = direct engagement with the target (human or technical), but only with legal approval.

### Active Reconnaissance
- Active reconnaissance involves making direct connections to the target machine to gather information.

- Logging Impact:
  - Such connections may be recorded in logs, showing details like:
   - Client IP address
   - Time of connection
   - Duration of connection

- Normal vs Suspicious Activity:
  - Not all connections appear suspicious.
  - Example: web browsing blends in with normal user traffic, making reconnaissance harder to detect.

- Red Team Advantage:
  - Attackers (red team) can disguise reconnaissance as regular client activity.
  - This helps avoid detection by defenders (blue team).


> Active reconnaissance = direct engagement with the target, which can leave traces in logs, but clever techniques (like blending in with normal browsing) allow red teams to gather information without raising alarms.



### Active Reconnaissance Tools
- **Web Browser + Developer Tools**:
  - Can be `armed` to gather detailed information about a target website.
  - Useful for inspecting elements, network requests, cookies, and headers.
- **Ping**:
  - Tests connectivity to a host.
  - Reveals if the target is reachable and provides round-trip time.
- **Traceroute**:
  - Maps the path packets take to reach the target.
  - Helps identify intermediate routers and network structure.
- **Telnet**:
  - Connects to specific ports/services.
  - Useful for testing service availability and banner grabbing.

>  These common tools (browser, ping, traceroute, telnet) are simple but powerful for active reconnaissance, since they directly interact with the target system or network.

## Task 2: Web Browser

### Web Browser in Active Reconnaissanc
- Convenience:
  - Browsers are available on all systems and can be used to gather information about a target.

- Transport Level Connections:
  - HTTP → TCP port 80 (default).
  - HTTPS → TCP port 443 (default).
  - Browsers hide these default ports in the address bar.
  - Custom ports can be specified, e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8834/` connects to port 8834 on localhost via HTTPS.

- Developer Tools:
  - Shortcut keys:
    - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
    - **Mac**: `Option + Command + I (⌥ + ⌘ + I)`
  - Available in Firefox, Chrome, and Chromium.
  - Capabilities:
    - Inspect and modify JavaScript files.
    - View and analyze cookies stored on your system.
    - Explore the folder structure of site content.
    - Monitor network requests and responses between browser and server.

> A web browser isn’t just for viewing pages—it can be “armed” with Developer Tools to inspect ports, cookies, scripts, and network traffic, making it a versatile tool for active reconnaissance.

- IF in this I test with tryhackme -> Go to `browser` -> type `tryhackme.com` -> `Ctrl + Shift + I`:
