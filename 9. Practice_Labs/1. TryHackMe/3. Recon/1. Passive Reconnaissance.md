## Task 1: Introduction 
<img width="1080" height="831" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ad48d9-076a-44d0-b098-a2ebbf1f60ec" />


## Task 2: Passive Versus Active Recon:
<img width="818" height="933" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efbc872b-36a0-4f17-9575-4f70f3edb735" />

Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. It is the first step in The Unified Kill Chain to gain an initial foothold on a system. We divide reconnaissance into:
  - Passive Reconnaissance
  - Active Reconnaissance


Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:
  - Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
  - Checking job ads related to the target website.
  - Reading news articles about the target company.

Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

## Task 3: Whois
WHOIS Protocol Summary
 • Specification: WHOIS follows RFC 3912.
 • Port: WHOIS servers listen on TCP port 43.
 • Responsibility: Domain registrars maintain WHOIS records for the domains they lease.
 • Function: WHOIS servers respond with domain-related information.
Information Retrieved via WHOIS
 • Registrar: Identifies the registrar where the domain was registered.
 • Registrant Contact Info: Name, organization, address, phone (may be hidden by privacy services).
 • Domain Dates:
 • Creation date (when first registered)
 • Update date (last modification)
 • Expiration date (renewal deadline)
 • Name Servers: Which servers resolve the domain name.

## Task 4: nslookup and dig


### What is nslookup?
• 	Definition: Stands for Name Server Look Up.
• 	Purpose: Queries DNS servers to resolve domain names into IP addresses.
• 	Use Case: Helps you find the IPv4/IPv6 address of a domain, check DNS records, or troubleshoot DNS issues.

#### Syntax:
````
nslookup [OPTIONS] DOMAIN_NAME [SERVER]
````

- OPTIONS → Query type (e.g., `A` for IPv4, `AAAA` for IPv6, `MX` for mail servers).
- DOMAIN_NAME → The domain you want to resolve (e.g., `tryhackme.com`).
- SERVER → The DNS server to query (optional). Examples:
- Cloudflare → `1.1.1.1` or `1.0.0.1`
- Google → `8.8.8.8` or `8.8.4.4`
- Quad9 → `9.9.9.9` or `149.112.112.112`


#### Basic IPv4 lookup:
````
nslookup tryhackme.com
````
<img width="424" height="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/747fd42e-dd6c-457e-8cf2-8fb08c374cf7" />

- Returns the IPv4 address of `tryhackme.com` using your default DNS server.


#### Explicit IPv4 query (A record):
````
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com
````
<img width="409" height="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108b19e2-ac5b-4ed7-8257-46b9304073e9" />



#### IPv6 query (AAAA record):
````
nslookup -type=AAAA tryhackme.com
````
<img width="439" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee88112-7363-4fd2-8e8c-a28699f4cebb" />


#### Query using Google DNS:
````
nslookup tryhackme.com 8.8.8.8
````
<img width="445" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f595c9be-3822-4962-85e5-632881b140df" />


#### case-insensitive
````
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1
````
<img width="494" height="219" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32b185b0-4ec6-42fd-9a29-48e960c0dc37" />



| Query Type | Result             |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| A          | IPv4 Addresses     |
| AAAA       | IPv6 Addresses     |
| CNAME      | Canonical Name     |
| MX         | Mail Servers       |
| SOA        | Start of Authority |
| TXT        | TXT Records        |

#### **Key Takeaway
 • WHOIS gives you registrar and DNS server info, while nslookup lets you resolve the actual IP address of a domain.
 • Together, they form the recon foundation in penetration testing: WHOIS for ownership/registrar details, nslookup for DNS/IP resolution.**



### DNS Record Types
 • A Record → Returns IPv4 address of a domain.
 • AAAA Record → Returns IPv6 address of a domain.
 • MX Record → Returns Mail Exchange servers responsible for handling email for the domain.


### nslookup Usage

#### Basic IPv4 lookup:
````
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com
````
<img width="410" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57608260-011b-4468-ba3b-8bc67406113e" />


#### IPv6 lookup:
````
nslookup -type=AAAA tryhackme.com
````
<img width="460" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba35da78-4bca-4622-bd42-135396b0f786" />


#### Mail server lookup:
````
nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com
````
<img width="688" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26a37e1a-cdc4-45da-95e8-a0eb68c70a6d" />

- Reveals the domain’s email servers and their configurations.


#### ** Key takeaway: A/AAAA records help map the domain to its IP infrastructure, while MX records reveal email server setups. Together, they expand reconnaissance and highlight possible targets for deeper security assessment.**





### MX Records (Mail Exchange)
- Purpose: MX records specify which mail servers handle email for a domain.
- Example (tryhackme.com):
  - Primary server (priority 1) → aspmx.l.google.com
  - Backup servers → alt1.aspmx.l.google.com, alt2.aspmx.l.google.com
- Behavior:
  - Mail servers attempt delivery to the lowest priority MX first.
  - If unavailable, they move to the next in order.
- Security Note:
  - Google’s servers are well-maintained, so vulnerabilities are unlikely.
  - Other domains may use outdated or misconfigured mail servers, which can be exploitable in penetration testing (if within scope).


### Reconnaissance Value
• MX records reveal email infrastructure.
• Potential attack surfaces:
  • Misconfigured mail servers
  • Weak authentication/encryption
  • Social engineering opportunities (targeting email systems)
• Privacy considerations: WHOIS and DNS often redact sensitive info to prevent abuse.




### Using dig for Advanced Queries
- Definition: `dig` = Domain Information Groper.

#### Basic syntax:
````
dig DOMAIN_NAME
````

#### Specify Record Type:
````
dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE
````


- Example:
````
dig tryhackme.com MX
````
<img width="872" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd40f4c-6f92-4579-a407-4187da224bc2" />


#### Query Specific DNS Server:
````
dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE
````

- Example using Google DNS:
````
dig @8.8.8.8 tryhackme.com MX
````
<img width="851" height="545" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7879f300-1e7d-4357-adbe-a86b7b14b0d1" />


### **Key Takeaway
• nslookup is simple and quick for basic lookups.
• dig provides more advanced functionality, detailed output, and flexibility in choosing DNS servers.
• Both tools are essential in passive reconnaissance, helping map out infrastructure before moving into deeper penetration testing phases.**





### nslookup vs dig
 • nslookup → Simple, quick, less detailed output.
 • dig → More advanced, includes extra info like TTL (Time To Live) by default, and allows flexible queries.

###  Commands to Run
#### Using nslookup:
````
slookup -type=MX tryhackme.com
````

- - Returns the mail exchange servers for `tryhackme.com`.



#### Using dig (default DNS):
````
dig tryhackme.com MX
````

- Returns MX records with TTL and additional details.


#### Using dig with Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1):
````
dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX
````

- Queries Cloudflare’s DNS server for MX records of `tryhackme.com`.
