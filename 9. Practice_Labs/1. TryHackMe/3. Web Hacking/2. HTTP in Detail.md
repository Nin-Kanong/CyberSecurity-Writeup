# Start Lab:




## Task 1: What is HTTP(S) 
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The basic set of rules for transferring web pages and resources (like text, images, videos) between your browser and a web server.

- **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**: The encrypted version of HTTP. It protects your data from being read or altered in transit and verifies you’re connected to the real server, not an imposter.
- Think of HTTPS as HTTP + security (encryption + authentication).

## Task 2: Requests And Responses:
### What is a URL?
A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is basically the "address" of something on the internet. It tells your browser how to access a resource (like a webpage, image, or file) and where to find it.


### Structure of a URL
A URL can have several parts, though not all are always used:
- Protocol → `http://` or `https://` Tells the browser how to communicate (secure or not).
- Domain name → `www.example.com` The server you’re connecting to.
- Port (optional) → `:80` or `:443` Specifies the network port (defaults are usually implied).
- Path → `/images/photo.jpg` The location of the resource on the server.
- Query string (optional) → `?id=123&sort=asc` Extra parameters sent to the server.
- Fragment (optional) → `#section2` Points to a specific part of the page


- Example: 
````
https://www.example.com:443/products/item?id=123#reviews
````
- `https://` → protocol
- `www.example.com` → domain
- `:443` → port
- `/products/item` → path
- `?id=123` → query string
- `#reviews` → fragment


<img width="1140" height="270" alt="34ad66d8b90aaaa35f9536d3b152ea97" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb07c35-3999-4494-a55e-62c62b5881ef" />


### Part of a URL
1. **Scheme**
  - Tells the browser which protocol to use.
  - Examples:​
    - `http://` → normal web traffic
    - `https://` → secure web traffic
    - `ftp://` → file transfer
2. **User**
  - Some services allow you to put a username (and sometimes password) directly in the URL.
  - Example: `ftp://user:password@host.com/`
3. **Host**
  - The domain name or IP address of the server you want to reach.
  - Example: `www.example.com` or `192.168.1.10`
4. **Port**
- The number that specifies which service you’re connecting to.
- Defaults:
   - `80` → HTTP
   - `443` → HTTPS
- But it can be any number between 1–65535.
- Example: `http://example.com:8080/`
5. **Path**
- The location of the resource (file or page) on the server.
- Example: `/blog/article.html`
6. **Query String**
- Extra information sent to the server, usually after a `?`.
- Example: `/blog?id=1` → asks for blog article with ID 1.
- Multiple queries can be joined with `&`: `/search?q=linux&page=2`.
7. **Fragment**
- A reference to a specific section of the page, after a #.
- Example: `http://example.com/page#section2` → jumps directly to “section2” on that page.


#### Example:
````
https://user:pass@www.example.com:443/blog?id=1#comments
````
- Scheme: `https://`
- User: `user:pass`
- Host: `www.example.com`
- Port: 443
- Path: /blog
- Query String: id=1
- Fragment: #comments

#### Making a Request
It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line GET / HTTP/1.1 
<img width="1140" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de549a6d-1e33-431f-adcb-45f4487a4f99" />


- To make web communication richer, browsers don’t just send the main request.
- They also send headers, which are small pieces of extra information.
- Headers tell the server details like who’s sending the request, what format is expected, or authentication info.
- headers = extra data that helps the server understand and respond properly.

**Example Request**:
````
GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
````

- **Line 1**: `GET / HTTP/1.1`: This request is using the GET method to ask the server for the home page (/). It also tells the server we’re speaking the HTTP protocol version 1.1.

- **Line 2**: `Host: tryhackme.com`: We tell the web server that the website we want is tryhackme.com. This is required in HTTP/1.1 because one server can host many websites.

- **Line 3**: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0` We tell the web server that we are using the Firefox browser, version 87. This helps the server know what kind of client is making the request.

- **Line 4**: `Referer: https://tryhackme.com/`: We are telling the web server that the page which referred us (the page we came from) is https://tryhackme.com/. This is used for analytics and sometimes for security checks.

- **Line 5**: (blank line): HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request is finished and no more headers are coming.


#### Example:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98


<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>
````

Breakdown each line of the response:

- **Line 1**: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`: This shows the protocol version the server is using (HTTP/1.1) and the status code (200 OK). It means the request was successful and the server is sending back the requested page.

- **Line 2**: `Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`: This tells us the web server software and version number. In this example, it’s Apache running on Ubuntu.

- **Line 3**: `Date: Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:21:00 GMT`: This shows the current date, time, and timezone of the server when it sent the response.

- **Line 4**: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`: This header tells the client what type of content is being sent. Here it’s HTML text, but it could also be images, videos, PDFs, or XML depending on the request.

- **Line 5**: `Content-Length: 10240`: This tells the client how many bytes long the response body is. It helps the browser confirm that all the data was received and nothing is missing.

- **Line 6**:(blank line): HTTP responses always include a blank line after the headers. This signals the end of the header section and the start of the actual content.

- **Lines 7–14**: The response body — this is the actual information you asked for. In this case, it would be the HTML code for the homepage of the site.

### Question 1: What HTTP protocol is being used in the above example?
<img width="844" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7caa59-86d0-4152-8232-d04c37d309a1" />

- After view about `GET / HTTP/1.1`, now we found the HTTP protocol is being used in the above example:
````
HTTP/1.1
````
<img width="828" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/843fcce0-eb0d-4ac7-bd60-2311bc73e3db" />

- Now we see the correct answer.

### Question 2: What response header tells the browser how much data to expect?


- In the response header tells the browser how much data to expect:
````
Content-Length: 98
````

- Now we found the correct:
````
Content-Length
````
