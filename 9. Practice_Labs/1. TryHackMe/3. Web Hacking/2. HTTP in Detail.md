# Start Lab:




## Task 1: What is HTTP(S) 
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The basic set of rules for transferring web pages and resources (like text, images, videos) between your browser and a web server.

- **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**: The encrypted version of HTTP. It protects your data from being read or altered in transit and verifies you’re connected to the real server, not an imposter.
- Think of HTTPS as HTTP + security (encryption + authentication).

## Task 2: Requests And Responses:
### What is a URL?
A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is basically the "address" of something on the internet. It tells your browser how to access a resource (like a webpage, image, or file) and where to find it.


### Structure of a URL
A URL can have several parts, though not all are always used:
- Protocol → `http://` or `https://` Tells the browser how to communicate (secure or not).
- Domain name → `www.example.com` The server you’re connecting to.
- Port (optional) → `:80` or `:443` Specifies the network port (defaults are usually implied).
- Path → `/images/photo.jpg` The location of the resource on the server.
- Query string (optional) → `?id=123&sort=asc` Extra parameters sent to the server.
- Fragment (optional) → `#section2` Points to a specific part of the page


- Example: 
````
https://www.example.com:443/products/item?id=123#reviews
````
- `https://` → protocol
- `www.example.com` → domain
- `:443` → port
- `/products/item` → path
- `?id=123` → query string
- `#reviews` → fragment

### Part of a URL
1. **Scheme**
  - Tells the browser which protocol to use.
  - Examples:
   - `http://` → normal web traffic
   - `https://` → secure web traffic
   - `ftp://` → file transfer
2. **User**
  - Some services allow you to put a username (and sometimes password) directly in the URL.
  - Example: `ftp://user:password@host.com/`
3. **Host**
  - The domain name or IP address of the server you want to reach.
  - Example: `www.example.com` or `192.168.1.10`
4. **Port**
- The number that specifies which service you’re connecting to.
- Defaults:
  - `80` → HTTP
  - `443` → HTTPS
- But it can be any number between 1–65535.
- Example: `http://example.com:8080/`
5. **Path**
- The location of the resource (file or page) on the server.
- Example: `/blog/article.html`
6. **Query String**
- Extra information sent to the server, usually after a `?`.
- Example: `/blog?id=1` → asks for blog article with ID 1.
- Multiple queries can be joined with `&`: `/search?q=linux&page=2`.
7. **Fragment**
- A reference to a specific section of the page, after a #.
- Example: `http://example.com/page#section2` → jumps directly to “section2” on that page.


#### Example:
````
https://user:pass@www.example.com:443/blog?id=1#comments
````
- Scheme: `https://`
- User: `user:pass`
- Host: `www.example.com`
- Port: 443
- Path: /blog
- Query String: id=1
- Fragment: #comments
