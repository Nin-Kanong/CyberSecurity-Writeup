### What is netcraft?
Netcraft is an Internet services company based in London, UK, specializing in cybersecurity and web analysis.

### What Netcraft is used for
Hackers and pentesters use Netcraft to:
    - Find hosting provider & IP range of a target.
    - Check SSL/TLS certificates (issuer, validity, vulnerabilities).
    - Detect technologies (server type, CMS, frameworks).
    - See historical data (past IPs, past hosting providers, old subdomains).
    - Identify phishing or suspicious sites.
    - Look for OS & uptime info on a target server.


## Usage:
- Go to this website:

https://searchdns.netcraft.com/

- Type what domain that we want to search:

- We can use any options:

### bad Request
- Go to this website:

https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=http://

- We see this:
<img width="1559" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6438e098-d1f9-4604-a015-cf51850cceb4" />

- We can search what domain that we want to search:

In this i want to search `ababank.com`:
<img width="1338" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/775175a7-82c6-4edf-837e-5d60aa33920e" />

- It sho like this:
<img width="1290" height="822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ea57b58-4b7b-45e0-b223-70be288eefe9" />

<img width="1179" height="439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4f0f53-070b-44a4-bc85-f72702ebb6c7" />

- If we want to search detail about IP like in this i want to search IP `103.108.218.2`:

#### Go to terminal in kali type:
##### 1. Check if the IP is reachable (Ping)
````
ping 103.108.218.2
````
<img width="521" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc996c6-5ad3-46ed-b169-c50c602bd894" />

- Tests if the host is online.
- Some servers block ping like above, so no response doesn’t mean it’s down.

##### 2. Trace the network path (Traceroute)
````
traceroute 103.108.218.2
````
<img width="628" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bb8c3d-559d-4bea-87ee-556799cec15d" />

- Why traceroute shows * * *
1. ICMP or UDP blocked
   - Many ISPs and routers block ICMP Time Exceeded replies (which traceroute depends on).
   - Some networks allow only TCP traffic, not ICMP/UDP probes.
2. Firewall filtering
   - Firewalls along the path drop traceroute probes.
   - Common in enterprise and ISP backbones.
3. NAT / private routing
   - If your network uses NAT, traceroute may only show your local gateway (192.168.127.2) and then nothing beyond.
4. Target does not reply
   - Even if the target is alive, it may not respond to traceroute probes.

##### 3.  Get whois information (Ownership & Location)
````
whois 103.108.218.2
````
<img width="690" height="795" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d613975c-83ad-453a-b5f6-e91749ec5de6" />

-  Owner (e.g., ISP or company)
- Country 
- Registration details
     
##### 4.  Scan open ports (with Nmap)
````
nmap -O -sV 103.108.218.2
````
<img width="838" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efab9c37-ac88-4f7d-9a72-84f1d89b31ec" />

- `-O` : Guess the operating system
- `-sV` : Detect service versions on open ports
- Useful for security assessment (only scan IPs you have permission to test)
     
##### We can use this for easy:
````
whois 103.108.218.2 | grep -i "country\|org-name"
````

**Disclaimer**: All scans are performed on my own lab environment or public training targets (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe). I do not scan systems without explicit authorization.


####  IF we want to detail more just click on IP it will be show detail about IP like:

### ============>>>> End Of netcraft

### why hacker use netcarft:
Hackers may use Netcraft’s public tools (e.g., site reports) for reconnaissance to identify server OS, technologies, or vulnerabilities for targeted attacks like XSS. Conversely, Netcraft’s anti-phishing tools help detect such attacks.
