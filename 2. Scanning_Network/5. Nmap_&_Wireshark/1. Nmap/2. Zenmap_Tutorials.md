# Zenmap Methodology
- In terminal:
````
zenmap
````

## In Zenmap (Intense Scan)
````

- In this we can choose `Profile` for scan

- `T4`: Sets timing to level 4 (aggressive but stable) for faster scanning.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- `-v`: Verbose output: shows more scan progress and details.
- **This command performs a deep scan across your local subnet, trying to:
  • 	Detect live hosts
  • 	Identify open ports
  • 	Fingerprint services and versions
  • 	Guess the operating system
  • 	Run Nmap scripts for extra info (like vulnerabilities or misconfigurations)**
- Why It's Useful:
  - Recon in exam labs
  - Finding targets to exploit
  - Documenting host/service changes with `ndiff`
  - Building GitHub recon notes


### Check **Ports/Hosts**
- Also in this we can select in each `Target IP`:

<img width="1028" height="828" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c0de25-dd91-4b85-b599-ac63a94e9e96" />


### Check in **Topology**

<img width="1050" height="822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbcb4a58-7dd8-4c62-8757-ac7d9d1a13d0" />

- In `Red` it mean this `Target` have more vulnerable.

What You're Seeing
- Central node ("localhost"): This is your Kali machine that ran the scan.
- Connected nodes: These are the IPs discovered during the scan (e.g., 192.168.127.1, .2, .128, .254).
- Lines between nodes: Show network relationships or scan paths (like traceroute hops).
- Color-coded nodes:
  - 🟩 Green = Active host (responded to scan)
  - 🟥 Red = Possibly unreachable or filtered
  - 🟨 Yellow terminal icon = Host with open ports or services

🔍 Why It’s Useful
  - Helps you visualize host discovery
  - Shows which devices are reachable
  - Reveals network structure (great for pivoting or lateral movement in labs)
  - Useful for documenting scan results in your GitHub recon notes


### In **Host Details**:
- In this wecan select specific IP to check more details:

### Check **Service**:

- In this we can check which target their service:

## Intense scan plus UDP

## Ping Scan
- In this we can choose otherse `Profile to Scan`:

- But in this i want to choose `Ping Scan`
