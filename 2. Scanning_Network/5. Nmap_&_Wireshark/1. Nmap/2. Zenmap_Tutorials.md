# Zenmap Methodology
- In terminal:
````
zenmap
````

<img width="1039" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6451cf64-65e9-4202-a823-6291067bd398" />


## In Zenmap (Intense Scan)

- In this we can choose `Profile` for scan
<img width="1037" height="825" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d85b3c00-61ae-4a40-9d25-e6866ddb1c1e" />


<img width="1032" height="817" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0543c6b3-6060-42ca-944c-6a1cc94158fc" />


<img width="1026" height="812" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69751e06-23b3-4827-a0a9-d6b39f4ff678" />


- `T4`: Sets timing to level 4 (aggressive but stable) for faster scanning.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- `-v`: Verbose output: shows more scan progress and details.
- **This command performs a deep scan across your local subnet, trying to:
  • 	Detect live hosts
  • 	Identify open ports
  • 	Fingerprint services and versions
  • 	Guess the operating system
  • 	Run Nmap scripts for extra info (like vulnerabilities or misconfigurations)**
- Why It's Useful:
  - Recon in exam labs
  - Finding targets to exploit
  - Documenting host/service changes with `ndiff`
  - Building GitHub recon notes


### Check **Ports/Hosts**
- Also in this we can select in each `Target IP`:
<img width="1036" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/235066a0-c745-43e3-b6ec-5ef3b6475661" />


<img width="1028" height="828" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c0de25-dd91-4b85-b599-ac63a94e9e96" />


### Check in **Topology**

<img width="1050" height="822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbcb4a58-7dd8-4c62-8757-ac7d9d1a13d0" />

- In `Red` it mean this `Target` have more vulnerable.

What You're Seeing
- Central node ("localhost"): This is your Kali machine that ran the scan.
- Connected nodes: These are the IPs discovered during the scan (e.g., 192.168.127.1, .2, .128, .254).
- Lines between nodes: Show network relationships or scan paths (like traceroute hops).
- Color-coded nodes:
  - 🟩 Green = Active host (responded to scan)
  - 🟥 Red = Possibly unreachable or filtered
  - 🟨 Yellow terminal icon = Host with open ports or services

🔍 Why It’s Useful
  - Helps you visualize host discovery
  - Shows which devices are reachable
  - Reveals network structure (great for pivoting or lateral movement in labs)
  - Useful for documenting scan results in your GitHub recon notes


### In **Host Details**:
- In this wecan select specific IP to check more details:

### Check **Service**:
<img width="1020" height="403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2e3329-76d6-457b-9a76-f7a31d76163a" />

- In this we can check which target their service:

## Intense scan plus UDP

<img width="1030" height="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bba5a97c-ad11-46fa-af08-416729306d38" />

<img width="1010" height="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a7379d-60e6-4f91-97fe-5774df82b515" />


- `-sS`: TCP SYN scan (stealthy and fast)
- `-sU`: UDP scan (checks for services like DNS, SNMP, etc.).
- `-T4`: Aggressive timing for faster scanning.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, traceroute.
- `-v`: Verbose output (shows detailed progress).
- **This command:
  - Finds live hosts
  - Detects open TCP and UDP ports
  - Identifies services and versions
  - Guesses the operating system
  - Runs Nmap scripts to find vulnerabilities
  - Maps network paths with traceroute**




## Ping Scan
- In this we can choose otherse `Profile to Scan`:
<img width="1027" height="572" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1569f1bc-7c0a-4c1a-b43a-36d2648d54ea" />

- But in this i want to choose `Ping Scan`

<img width="1027" height="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c12e93d-e4f4-461e-a0f1-f384a32145ed" />

- `-sn`: Ping scan only — skips port scanning.
- **This command checks which hosts are online in the subnet. It sends ICMP echo requests (pings) and ARP requests (on local networks) to detect live devices.**




## Scan Multiple Target - Quick Scan
````
192.168.127.129 scanme.nmap.org
````

- In this i choose `Quick Scan`
<img width="1915" height="896" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8e655e1-bdbb-498d-b81f-b360eee07476" />

- `-t4`: Aggressive timing for faster scanning
- `-F`: Fast scan: scans only the top 100 most common ports
- **This command performs a quick scan of the most common ports on the target IP. It’s useful when you want fast results without scanning all 65,535 ports.**
