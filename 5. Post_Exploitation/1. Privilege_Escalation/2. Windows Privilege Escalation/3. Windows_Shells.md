# Introduction To Windows Shell

## What is Windows Shell?
**Windows Shell**: IS a shell is a command-line interface that allows a user to interact with an operating system. In penetration testing and red teaming, gaining a shell on a target machine is often a primary objective because it provides direct access to execute commands, move laterally, and escalate privileges.


## Why Windows Shells?
- Windows is widely used in enterprise environments.
- Provides access to internal networks, Active Directory, and sensitive data.
- Essential for post-exploitation activities.



## Type of Windows Shells
1. **Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)**
- **Type**: Legacy command-line interpreter (based on MS-DOS)
- **Prompt**: `C:\>`
- **File extension**: `.bat`, `.cmd`
- **Features**:
  - Basic command execution (`dir`, `copy`, `ping`, etc.)
  - Simple batch scripting
  - Limited variables, no native pipes for structured data
- **Use case**: Legacy scripts, basic automation, compatibility

2. **Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe` / `pwsh.exe`)**
- **Type**: Object-oriented task automation and configuration management framework
- **Prompt**: `PS C:\>`
- **File extension**: `.ps1`
- **Features**:
  - Commands (cmdlets) return objects, not just text
  - Full access to .NET framework
  - Advanced scripting, pipelines, error handling
  - Can manage Windows internals (registry, services, WMI, AD, etc.)
- **Versions**:
  - Windows PowerShell (5.1): Built into Windows
  - PowerShell 7+ (pwsh): Cross-platform, open-source, modern

3. **Windows Terminal (Host Application, Not a Shell)**
- **Type**: Modern terminal host (not a shell itself)
- **Supports**:
  - Command Prompt
  - PowerShell
  - PowerShell 7+
  - WSL (Linux shells)
  - Azure Cloud Shell
- **Features**:
  - Tabs, panes, GPU-accelerated text rendering
  - Custom themes, fonts, key bindings
- Installed separately from Microsoft Store (default in Windows 11)

4. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Shells**
- **Type**: Linux-compatible shell environment
- **Access via**: `wsl` command or Windows Terminal
- Common shells inside WSL:
  - `bash` (default in most distros)
  - `zsh`, `fish`, `sh`
- File extension: `.sh`
- Use case: Run Linux tools (grep, ssh, python3, apt, etc.) natively on Windows

5. **Recovery / Special-Purpose Shells**
- Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) Command Prompt
  - Accessed during troubleshooting/recovery
  - Limited drivers and tools
- Safe Mode Command Prompt
  - Minimal boot environment

# Windows Shells Methodology 
- After we get `meterpreter` -> get `Shell`:

- Now we got target `Shell`.
- In this we see on `Downloads`, cause we click on `Payload` on Downloads.

## 1. CMD vs PowerShell

### **CMD (Command Prompt)**
- Legacy shell from MS-DOS (1980s)
- Lightweight, minimal overhead
- Limited scripting capabilities
- Basic commands only
- File extension: `.bat` or `.cmd`
- Maximum 8191 characters per line


PowerShell
- Modern shell (2006+)
- Object-oriented (everything is an object)
- Full scripting language with loops, conditions, functions
- .NET Framework integration
- Remote management capabilities
- File extension: `.ps1`
- Pipeline passes objects, not just text


### Difference:
| **Feature**           | **CMD**           | **PowerShell**                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Output Type           | Text              | Objects                         |
| Scripting             | Basic batch files | Advanced scripting (.NET-based) |
| Pipeline              | Text only         | Objects                         |
| Remote Administration | Limited           | Native support                  |
| Security              | Basic             | Execution policies              |
| Help System           | `command /?`      | `Get-Help` command              |
| Aliases               | Few               | Many (including CMD aliases)    |


#### When to Use Which
- **Use CMD**: for Quick tasks, legacy scripts, simple file operations
- **Use PowerShell**: for Automation, system administration, complex tasks

### 2. DIRECTORY NAVIGATION

#### List directory contents
````
dir
````
<img width="606" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eaa5db8-cef7-428f-a43a-a48af61b8da5" />

- `.` & `..`:
  - `.`: Current Directory.
  - `..`: parent directory
- Files: `ChromeSetup.exe`, `Firefox Installer.exe`, and `rev.ps1`...




#### Show hidden files
````
dir /ah
````
<img width="612" height="223" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d82ae793-9175-4b8f-a7bb-4cf81c9c88be" />

- **File Found**:
  - `desktop.ini` (282 bytes)
   - This is a hidden system file automatically created by Windows.
   - It stores folder customization settings (like icons, localized names, or view preferences).
   - Every folder can have its own `desktop.ini` if customized.
- **No Hidden Directories**:
  - The output shows `0 Dir(s)`, meaning there are no hidden folders in `Downloads`.
- Free Space:
  - About 13.2 GB free on your C: drive.





#### List recursively 
````
dir /s
````

<img width="661" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9630b7aa-74b5-4543-82b1-725453b33b1b" />

- 5 files totaling ≈ 60.5 MB.
- 2 directories (`.` current, `..` parent).
- Free space: ≈ 13.2 GB.

- We can use this command `dir /s /ah`.


#### List specific file types
````
dir *.txt
````
<img width="461" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b565c0-954d-4c29-8248-9e75231ec028" />

- So it mean in `C:\Users\k4n0ng\Downloads` have no file that end with `.txt`.



#### Change directory
````
cd
````
<img width="336" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fbfa2b8-192a-4608-9964-38ea5170c6c7" />

- We can change directory to others if in our folder have one folder.


#### Go up one level
````
cd ..
````
<img width="390" height="107" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b79f1dc-7140-4a07-a8d4-1de022c3ed19" />


#### Go to root directory
````
cd \ 
````

<img width="332" height="105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4556ab58-66de-40bb-9f06-2faa5b88e645" />



#### Save current directory and change
````
pushd C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents
````
<img width="396" height="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a143d8-c1cb-477d-9cee-e459b23e9d11" />




### 3. FILE OPERATIONS
In this first I need to create file with `.txt` on my windows -> press `Ctrl + S` -> type `Notepad`:
<img width="635" height="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e4be33e-2a0d-45c5-b1fd-22a0ac198c59" />

After press `Ctrl + S` -> Go to `Document` -> input name -> Click `Save`:
<img width="953" height="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e66c0a1-2c99-42d6-a781-95277c014cab" />

<img width="547" height="303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f14b85-20c1-4d15-bd11-722ce8628e51" />

Now we see our `file.txt`.



#### View file contents:
````
type file.txt
````
<img width="478" height="111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6b2b110-48ff-4a30-94e2-816bf5e49211" />

This it the same `cat` or `string` in kali.

#### View file page by page:
````
more file.txt
````
<img width="427" height="114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3302868-198a-4532-aff6-db6f1bd055d1" />

- Shows the contents of `file.txt` one screen at a time.
- Since your file is short (only one line), it looks the same as `type`.
- If the file were longer, `more` would pause after each screenful of text, letting you scroll through with the spacebar.


#### Copy files:
````
copy file.txt Desktop
````
<img width="529" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad019fa6-e833-420b-8c17-d14523faf70c" />

- Copies `file.txt` into the `Desktop` folder (new folder on `Documents)`.
- **Syntax**: `copy source destination`:
  - `source`: the file you want to copy.
  - `destination`: where you want the copy to go (can be a folder or a new filename).

<img width="597" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/652767a4-351c-449d-be0e-4d9178111446" />





#### Copy folders recursively
First in this I need to create new folder:
<img width="985" height="417" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888a60ed-38cf-4e5b-8673-ee168f061b4f" />

- Also I create one file name `folder.txt`:
<img width="981" height="583" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dea9c1a4-4c37-476e-84d2-cb0816d6915b" />


````
xcopy file.txt Backup\
````
<img width="537" height="147" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b9ffb4-ba48-4c76-a0a3-36349d27675c" />

<img width="576" height="345" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/716e6abc-0851-4822-a1ca-e408ad359a50" />


- **Syntax**: `xcopy source destination`.


#### Move/rename files
````
move source dest
````
<img width="588" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f98e0167-c68d-47be-98ec-97abe0079354" />

<img width="603" height="453" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2255fa3-a843-4b07-966c-9d8013f524b7" />

- `move`: relocates a file or folder from one place to another (unlike copy, which duplicates).
- `file.txt.txt`: the source file you wanted to move.
- `Backup`: the destination folder inside `C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents`.




#### del file.txt
````
del file.txt
````
<img width="551" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3fe6fe8-a99d-4bd3-8b55-ab776df0aa9a" />

Now we see we was delete file `file.txt`.


#### Force delete read-only files
````
del /F file.txt
````
<img width="612" height="325" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a045136-83a9-4e0a-bd36-dd421d0bad01" />

- `del`: deletes a file.
- `/F`: forces deletion even if the file is marked read‑only.
- `file.txt.txt`: the target file inside `C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents\Backup`.
- Result:
  - The file `file.txt.txt` was successfully deleted.
  - Running `dir` afterward shows the updated contents of the `Backup` folder:
   - Only `folder.txt` remains (28 bytes).
   - `file.txt.txt` is gone.
   - The free space on drive C is listed (`13,214,117,888 bytes free`).




#### Rename file
````
ren file.txt NoFile.txt
````
<img width="631" height="621" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f2a001-fc00-441b-976b-6670bbdde7b0" />

- **Syntax**: `ren old.txt new.txt`.



### 4. SYSTEM CONTROL

#### Clear screen
````
cls
````
<img width="415" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd221cdd-34e2-4746-9398-ffd9af91816a" />


#### Close CMD
````
exit
````
<img width="432" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfbbf2b9-1020-410b-b370-a8c2e801a4ee" />

Now we was `exit` target `shell` to target `meterpreter`.


#### Wait for key press
````
pause
````
<img width="412" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/442fb5cd-98c3-4698-a51f-dd853d0c66d5" />


#### Display/set time
````
time
````
<img width="542" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53b2160-047d-4a29-82a2-1559762a931b" />



#### Display/set date
````
date
````
<img width="387" height="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2541ad6-7fe5-4a69-90d6-24672359a8b7" />


#### Change colors (0=black bg, A=green text)
````
color 0A
````
<img width="289" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5cc0cf9-7347-4237-91f0-90dac9baf947" />

- The `color` command changes the background and text colors in Command Prompt.
- It takes two hexadecimal digits:
  - The first digit = background color.
  - The second digit = text (foreground) color.

---



## 3. CMD File System Commands

### 1. Advanced File Operations

#### 1. ATTRIBUTES (File Permissions)

##### Show file attributes
````
attrib
````
<img width="1328" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66b4cc90-f7c2-4696-b71b-7cc6ce66be7e" />

- The `attrib` command shows or changes file attributes in Windows.
- Attributes are flags that control how files behave (hidden, read-only, system, etc.).

| Attribute | Meaning                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A         | Archive — file is marked for backup or archiving                    |
| R         | Read-only — file cannot be modified                                 |
| H         | Hidden — file is not normally visible in File Explorer              |
| S         | System — file is a system file protected by Windows                 |
| I         | Not content indexed — file is excluded from Windows Search indexing |



##### Make file Read-only
````
attrib +R file.txt
````
<img width="500" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009543e4-460f-416b-8328-b18da93e4c4d" />

- `attrib`: manages file attributes.
- `+R`: adds the Read-only attribute to the file.
- `file.txt`: the target file in your current directory


- To check it -> Go to our target windows -> `Right-Click` -> click on `Properties`:
<img width="923" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb908aac-6d6e-403f-8ad0-51482864048f" />

Now we see `Read-Only`:
<img width="366" height="512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e64f6e7-f421-4dfb-bbb4-4b3a949f16e3" />




##### Remove Read-only
````
attrib -R file.txt
````
<img width="519" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe6627d-45f0-40b1-a55a-ad6f6e3062ab" />

- To check it -> Go to our target windows -> `Right-Click` -> click on `Properties`:
<img width="923" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb908aac-6d6e-403f-8ad0-51482864048f" />

Now we don't see anything:
<img width="362" height="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/027e9ccc-6fbb-4837-ba9d-93eb4fd9e35c" />




##### Hide File
````
attrib +H file.txt
````
<img width="528" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872ddd10-cdef-46e3-8b30-89fe1eaa53f7" />

- To check it -> - Open `File Explorer` and go to `C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents` -> By default, hidden files won’t show.
: 
<img width="967" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17cf82e-2f71-4102-bc20-1be1912661d7" />

- To reveal them:
  - Click the View tab.
  - Check **Hidden items**.
  - Now you’ll see `file.txt` appear slightly faded, indicating it’s hidden.
<img width="1122" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f7361f-96f8-42d8-b87b-13939e80b6f9" />

Now we see our `Hidden file`.

- OR we can use command.

##### Unhide File:
````
attrib -H file.txt
````
<img width="496" height="105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d99807-c2b9-40fa-91d5-1d7fca54e3a7" />

After back to our windows:
<img width="926" height="617" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16386a29-870f-4a63-b99e-8a973109575a" />

Now we see our file.

##### Make System file:
````
attrib +S file.txt
````
<img width="474" height="121" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/809d91c5-5e73-4252-a71a-7aedb3548fcb" />

- `attrib`: manages file attributes.
- `+S`: adds the System attribute.
- `file.txt`: the target file in your current directory


To check it:
````
attrib file.txt
````
<img width="630" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee0d66b-22ec-4193-bd9e-9d16fb389c0c" />

- Or if we want to remove system attribute `attrib -S file.txt`.




#### 2. Compare Files

##### Compare two files
````
fc file1.txt file2.txt
````
<img width="611" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf00b853-9293-42c7-9d14-be7023a46d09" />

- `fc`: File Compare.
- It compares the contents of two files line by line and shows the differences

- `Comparing files folder.txt and NOFILE.TXT`: confirms which files are being compared.
- `***** folder.txt`: shows the line from `folder.txt` that differs.
  - Content: `Hello this is my new folder`.
- `***** NOFILE.TXT`: shows the line from NoFile.txt that differs.
  - Content: `Hello this is my windows file`
- `*****`: marks the end of the difference block.





#### 3. Disk Management
##### Check disk for errors
````
chkdsk C:
````
<img width="632" height="136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb75642-fac5-4f2d-ab2b-a3da6d7c4e02" />

- `chkdsk`: Check Disk. It scans a drive for errors, bad sectors, and file system issues.
- `C:`: the drive you asked it to check (your main system drive).

- Check Drive `D`:
````
chkdsk D:
````
<img width="791" height="617" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639b020a-c941-4e9a-aa1a-c80b5f4108ce" />




##### Format a drive
````
format D:
````
<img width="577" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6743d07f-e796-4b03-b3e3-1d7fb90a125c" />

- You’re trying to **format the D: drive**.
- Windows detected that the current file system on D: is UDF (Universal Disk Format), which is commonly used for DVDs, Blu‑ray discs, or sometimes external drives.
- Before formatting, Windows asks you to enter the current volume label (the name of the drive) to confirm you really want to erase it

- Next Step:
````
dir D:
````
<img width="587" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98650cf5-2ca0-4c3d-acd5-ba13ee21230b" />

- **ESD‑ISO** is typically a **bootable Windows installation media** (USB stick or mounted ISO).
- That’s why the file system shows as UDF earlier - **UDF** is common for optical discs and ISO images.
- Notice the `0 bytes free` → this drive is read‑only. You can’t add or delete files because it’s an ISO image or a protected USB.

- OR
````
vol D:
````
<img width="496" height="151" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d1e6867-eb33-4293-8db0-535946e60e38" />




##### Format with NTFS
````
format D: /FS:NTFS
````
<img width="530" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14311804-123b-4a27-89ca-10b26dd15752" />

This mean:
- Our D: drive is currently UDF (Universal Disk Format).
- UDF is used for optical discs (DVDs, Blu‑ray) or mounted ISO images.
- These devices are read‑only or have special formatting rules, so Windows cannot reformat them into NTFS.
- That’s why the `format /FS:NTFS` command fails.

- If D: is a mounted ISO file → you cannot format it at all. You’d need to eject/unmount it.
- If D: is a DVD or Blu‑ray disc → it’s not rewritable unless it’s a special RW disc, and even then NTFS isn’t supported.
- If D: is a USB stick created as Windows installation media → it may be locked in UDF mode. To reuse it, you’d need to use Disk Management or diskpart to clean and reformat.




#### 4. Directory Management 
##### Create a directory
````
mkdir folder
````
<img width="626" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2181ffed-05ab-412d-84d9-9c45e299689d" />


##### Remove an empty directory
````
rmdir folder
````
<img width="622" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb4b5fd3-796a-4782-bbe7-53452aec25d1" />

Now we don't see our folder name `folder` like above.

##### Remove a directory and its contents
- First I need to create one folder and file:
<img width="769" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d9037d-e32a-4dbd-a771-f98c3623a3ee" />


````
rmdir /S folder
````
<img width="688" height="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef5b3a07-7345-490c-9f96-eca91e0ead4a" />


##### Display folder structure
````
tree
````
<img width="584" height="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3108c51b-d1d9-4f61-9c1f-bcf31b20d954" />

In this we don't digram or tree like in Windows:
<img width="449" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f1336eb-93ff-4ca0-b27c-d910e9934d2d" />

Now we see like tree.

- `tree` displays the folder hierarchy of the current drive or path in a graphical “tree” format.
- It shows all subdirectories branching out, so you can quickly see the structure.



##### Display folder structure including files
````
tree /F
````
<img width="536" height="813" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d95ee5f3-95da-4b6f-a402-cec8ffd5a0ef" />


##### Display tree using ASCII characters
````
tree /A
````
<img width="478" height="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e0f13e3-9dc3-4fbc-8e5f-5eccbfbe90b6" />

- `/A`: forces the output to use ASCII characters (`+`, `|`, `\`) instead of extended line‑drawing characters.
  - This is useful if your console font doesn’t support the graphical line characters, or if you want to copy the output into a plain text file



- Or we can use with direct folder:
````
tree C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents
````
<img width="475" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3687eb5d-bfdf-457f-a482-b310199c8a19" />






#### 5. Search & Find 

##### Search for text inside a file
````
find "text" file.txt
````
<img width="518" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ec2235-c1cc-4a1f-8ac4-3576ff337772" />


##### Search all files
````
findstr /S "Hello" *.*
````
<img width="1917" height="794" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbfe8cbf-179f-4b09-a472-935f554adc03" />

- Searches every file for “Hello”.



##### Case-insensitive search
````
findstr /I "error" *.log
````





#### 6. File Information
##### Show file extension association
````
ssoc .txt
````
<img width="454" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656cebbd-8b9a-4e98-8067-e496740e75cc" />

- `assoc`: Displays or modifies file extension associations.
- `.txt`: The file extension you want to check.
- Running this shows which program is associated with `.txt` files

- Check:
````
ftype txtfile
````
<img width="498" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eebfb50-49bc-4c4d-b4a0-bcc2a0610525" />




##### Show program used to open a file type
````
ftype txtfile
````
<img width="473" height="97" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a019e81a-743e-4603-9f63-3382326dd2d0" />





### 2. Usefull File Management Scripts

#### Clean temp files
````
@echo off
del /Q /F /S %TEMP%\*.*
del /Q /F /S C:\Windows\Temp\*.*
echo Temp files cleaned
````
<img width="988" height="783" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a36fd86-9c2d-4c8f-b7f1-bfe49563f521" />

## CMD Permission Commands


### Windows Permissions Management

#### 1. FILE PERMISSIONS

##### View permissions
````
icacls file.txt
````
<img width="661" height="230" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c31c288d-a785-4cb5-a41b-2c540e2cabd1" />

- `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)`
  - The SYSTEM account has Full control (F).
  - `(I)` means the permission is Inherited from the parent folder.
- `BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)`
  - All members of the Administrators group have Full control.
  - Also inherited.
- `DESKTOP-PNITAG8\k4n0ng:(I)(F)`
  - Our user account (`k4n0ng`) has Full control.
  - Inherited as well.
- Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
  - Confirms the command ran correctly and checked exactly one file


- We can use to see permissions for all files in a folder:
````
icacls C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents
````
<img width="665" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e11607-253c-44c4-9ba6-563beca984c3" />

- To grant read‑only access to another user:
````
icacls file.txt /grant k4n0ng:R
````
- To reset permissions to default inheritance:
````
icacls file.txt /reset
````



##### Grant full control to a user
````
icacls file.txt /grant k4n0ng:F
````
<img width="621" height="111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd14579c-375c-4228-86de-62a71dbbbc83" />

- `/grant k4n0ng:F`: grants the user k4n0ng Full control (F) over the file

- We can use others command:
To grant read-only access:
````
icacls file.txt /grant k4n0ng:R
````
To remove permissions:
````
icacls file.txt /remove k4n0ng
````
To list current permissions again:
````
icacls file.txt
````
To apply permissions recursively to a folder:
````
icacls C:\Users\k4n0ng\Documents /grant k4n0ng:F /T
````


##### Grant permissions recursively to a folder
````
icacls Backup /grant k4n0ng:(OI)(CI)F
````
<img width="736" height="326" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50023d0b-fba5-4a64-9210-002dfe2028b0" />

- `DESKTOP-PNITAG8\k4n0ng:(OI)(CI)(F)`
  - Explicit grant: my account `k4n0ng` has Full control (F).
  - `(OI)`: Object Inherit → files inside inherit this permission.
  - `(CI)`: Container Inherit → subfolders inherit this permission.
- `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)`
  - The Windows SYSTEM account has full control, inherited from the parent folder.
- `BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)`
  - All members of the Administrators group have full control, inherited.
- `DESKTOP-PNITAG8\k4n0ng:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)`
  - Your account also inherits full control from the parent folder.
  - So you now have two entries: one explicit grant, one inherited.



##### Enable permission inheritance
````
icacls Backup /inheritance:e
````
<img width="638" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7ac2dd4-601a-458b-a16a-0551496e17dc" />

- `Backup` is my folder.
- `e` (enable), `d` (disable), and `r` (remove inherited permissions).

##### Reset permissions to parent defaults
````
icacls Backup /reset
````
<img width="647" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a26d25b8-d797-43b6-9fd0-63dd9f83094e" />





---



#### 2. Take Ownership

##### Take ownership of a file
````
takeown /F file.txt
````
<img width="1157" height="112" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a472058-f11d-41a2-9537-3535f5244b72" />

- `takeown`: A command that lets you take ownership of a file or folder.
- `/F Hello.txt`: Specifies the target file (Hello.txt)
**Note**: `Hello.txt` is my file.



##### Take ownership recursively of a folder
````
takeown /F Backup /R /D Y
````
<img width="1252" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae623a3e-49e7-4a95-b32f-4a8f8853f530" />

- `/F Backup`: Target is the `Backup` folder.
- `/R`: Recursive, applies to all files and subfolders inside `Backup`.
- `/D Y`: Automatically answers "Yes" to any confirmation prompts (useful when ownership is being changed on multiple items).

- Check ownership and permissions:
````
icacls Backup
````
<img width="632" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97279f9a-4fd7-4678-ab04-23ecdbf5d006" />

**Meaning of Flags**:
- `(I)`: Inherited (permissions flow down from the parent folder).
- `(OI)`: Object Inherit (files inside inherit these permissions).
- `(CI)`: Container Inherit (subfolders inherit these permissions).
- `(F)` Full control.



#### 3. CACLS (Legacy – Use ICACLS Instead)
##### View permissions
````
cacls Hello.txt
````
<img width="653" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13fefec3-d40c-4c14-adf2-67b5e6e383d4" />

- Every listed principal (SYSTEM, Administrators, and you) can read, write, modify, and delete the file.
- There are no restrictions or deny rules here — it’s wide open for those accounts.

- Or in this if I use others file `file.txt`:
````
cacls file.txt
````
<img width="881" height="535" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba5c1c26-909d-4cb5-bdb4-dd69af625187" />




##### Grant full control to a user
````
cacls Hello.txt /E /G k4n0ng:F
````
<img width="610" height="126" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10d6964f-a3e2-42a4-8ecc-2e1b2b2b223a" />

- `cacls`: Legacy command to view or modify file permissions (deprecated, replaced by icacls in modern Windows).
- `Hello.txt`: The target file.
- `/E`: Edit the existing ACL instead of replacing it.
- `/G k4n0ng:F`: Grant the user k4n0ng Full control (F).



##### Remove a user from permissions
````
cacls Hello.txt /E /R k4n0ng
````
<img width="591" height="118" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05992ff5-b8f4-43af-bfb4-1c077b6bfbcd" />

- This command removed all permissions for k4n0ng on Hello.txt. we can still recover access because you’re the owner, but right now our account has no rights to the file.
- To check it:
````
cacls Hello.txt
````
<img width="651" height="120" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20a8396-14d9-4d8d-981b-981ce7d7681c" />





#### 4. File Ownership & Privileges

##### What i stay in:
````
whoami
````
<img width="383" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33607083-7b0c-4536-8b26-52d983867699" />


##### Show current user and security info
````
whoami /all
````
<img width="1456" height="577" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f4e9220-7787-470d-961b-5ede1c74eb68" />

<img width="802" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfe4f2eb-8c4f-46a0-8809-d43f7d815786" />

This command displays detailed information about the logged‑in user, including:
- **User name**: `DESKTOP-PNITAG8\k4n0ng`
- **SID (Security Identifier)**: unique ID for your account
- **Groups that we belong to**: `Administrators`, `Users`, `Everyone`, `Authenticated Users`
- **Privileges**: special rights like `SeShutdownPrivilege`, `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`
- **Authentication details**: logon ID, session info
- **Integrity level**: Medium, High, or System



##### Show user privileges
````
whoami /priv
````
<img width="797" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aea4dcce-41ce-4d97-b242-5d0e911de509" />

- `SeShutdownPrivilege`: Ability to shut down the system.
  - `State: Disabled`: You don’t currently have this privilege active.
- `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege` → “Bypass traverse checking.”
  - Lets you traverse folders even if you don’t have explicit permissions on each one.
  - `State: Enabled`: This is always enabled for normal users, so you can navigate directory trees.
- `SeUndockPrivilege`: Ability to undock the computer (for laptops with docking stations).
  - `State: Disabled`: Not active.
- `SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege`: Ability to increase the memory (working set) of a process.
  - `State: Disabled`: Not active.
- `SeTimeZonePrivilege`: Ability to change the system time zone.
  - `State: Disabled`: Not active.



##### Show group memberships
````
whoami /groups
````
<img width="1469" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c82dda9-054a-42c9-b117-0f6b9d4c32dc" />
