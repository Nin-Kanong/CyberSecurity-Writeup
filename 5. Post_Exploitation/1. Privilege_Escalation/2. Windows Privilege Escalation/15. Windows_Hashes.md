# INTRODUCTION TO WINDOWS HASHES

## Explain about Windows Hashes

### What are Windows Hashes?
Windows hashes are cryptographic representations of passwords used for authentication. Instead of storing plain-text passwords, Windows stores hashed versions.


### Types of Windows Hashes:
LM (LAN Manager) - Old, insecure (disabled by default since Vista/2008)
NTLM (NT LAN Manager) - Current challenge-response protocol
NTLMv2 - Enhanced version of NTLM
Kerberos - Ticket-based authentication (Active Directory)



## Where Hashes Are Stored
### SAM Database
- Location: ``C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM``
- Contains: Local user account hashes
- Protected by: SYSTEM boot key (SYSTEM registry hive)



### NTDS.DIT (Active Directory)
- Location: ``C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit``
- Contains: Domain user account hashes
- Protected by: Boot key and additional encryption

### LSASS Memory
- Location: ``LSASS.exe`` process memory
- Contains: Cached credentials, tickets, and hashes
- Why important: Hashes are available in plain memory during sessions

### Cached Credentials
- Location: Registry - ``HKLM\SECURITY\Cache``
- Contains: Last 10-50 domain logins (configurable)
- Purpose: Allows login when domain controller is unavailable
