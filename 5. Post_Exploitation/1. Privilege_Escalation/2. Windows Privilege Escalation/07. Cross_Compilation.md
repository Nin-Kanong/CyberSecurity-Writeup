# Introduction to Cross-Compilation


## What is Cross-Compilation?



### Basic Concept:
````
Cross-compilation = Compiling code on one system (e.g., Kali Linux)
                    to run on a DIFFERENT system (e.g., Windows)
````


### Why Cross-Compile?
- No compiler on target - Windows might not have gcc, make, etc.
- Faster development - Compile on powerful Kali, run on slower Windows
- Environment issues - Target might lack libraries or dependencies
- Stealth - Don't leave compiler tools on target system



## On Compilation
With `compilation` we refer to the act of `translating` a source code into a language that is then able to execute on a given CPU architecture.
````
source code ---> compilation ---> binary
````
- Compilation can be a complex process involving multiple stages.
- The general idea however is binaries are compiled for specific environments. Here with `environment` we mean a combination of:
  - Hardware Architecture
  - Operating System
  - Other user-space program and configurations
