# Introduction To Windows Privileged Escalation:

## What is Privileged Escalation?
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.

In Windows, users have different privilege levels:

| Level                     | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Guest / Standard User** | Very limited access                          |
| **Local User**            | Normal daily use                             |
| **Administrator**         | Can change system settings                   |
| **SYSTEM**                | Highest privilege (more powerful than admin) |



## Windows is Not Open-Source
- inux is an open-source operating system initially developed by Linus Torvalds around 1991 and currently developed by the open-source community. To this day it is still maintained by Torvalds.

- Windows is a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft. This means that we have less knowledge about the internal functioning of Windows.

- It also means that the kernel of the operating system and the external user-space programs cannot be taken apart. For example, in Linux you have different user-space programs using the same kernel,
