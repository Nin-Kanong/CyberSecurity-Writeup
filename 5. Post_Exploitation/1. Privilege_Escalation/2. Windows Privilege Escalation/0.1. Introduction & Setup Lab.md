# Introduction To Windows Privileged Escalation:

## What is Privileged Escalation?
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.

In Windows, users have different privilege levels:

| Level                     | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Guest / Standard User** | Very limited access                          |
| **Local User**            | Normal daily use                             |
| **Administrator**         | Can change system settings                   |
| **SYSTEM**                | Highest privilege (more powerful than admin) |
