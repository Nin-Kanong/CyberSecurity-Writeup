# Introduction to Windows Weak Service Permissions 

## What is Windows Weak Service Permissions?
**Windows weak service permissions**: refer to misconfigurations in the access control settings of Windows services that allow non-privileged users to modify or manipulate those services. This is a common privilege escalation vector in Windows environments, especially during penetration testing or red team engagements.

### How Windows Services Work
- **Service**: A background app managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM).
- **Runs as**: A specific account (e.g., LocalSystem, LocalService, NetworkService).
- **Protected by**: A permission list (DACL) that says who can start, stop, or change the service.


### What are Service Permissions?
````
Every Windows Service has a Security Descriptor (SD) that controls:
1. Who can START/STOP the service
2. Who can CHANGE its configuration  
3. Who can QUERY its status
4. Who can DELETE the service
````



## What makes permissions “weak”
If low‑privileged users (like “Users” or “Authenticated Users”) are allowed to change important parts of a service, that’s weak. The risky permissions are:
- **SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG**: Lets someone change the service’s executable path—dangerous because they can point it to their own program.
- **WRITE_DAC**: Lets someone change the service’s permissions—so they can grant themselves more power.
- **WRITE_OWNER**: Lets someone take ownership—then they can rewrite the permissions however they want.
- **GENERIC_WRITE / GENERIC_ALL**: Broad rights that include the dangerous ones above—effectively full control.


### Why are Weak Service Permissions Dangerous?
If a low-privilege user can modify a service that runs as SYSTEM, they can:
- Change the executable path
- Replace it with malicious code
- Restart the service
- Get SYSTEM privileges!
