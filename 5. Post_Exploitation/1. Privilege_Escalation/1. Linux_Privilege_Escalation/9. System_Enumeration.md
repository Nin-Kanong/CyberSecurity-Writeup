<h1 align="center"> System Enumeration </h1>







## What is System Enumeration?
System Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target system to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors for privilege escalation. It's the FIRST and MOST CRITICAL step after gaining initial access.





## Why Enumeration is Crucial?
- You can't exploit what you don't know exists
- Every system is unique - different configurations, different vulnerabilities
- Saves time by focusing on realistic attack paths


## Why is Enumeration Important?
- Thw first thing we should do once we obtain a reverse shell into a linux system is `Enumeration`.
- Enumeration is all about gathering meaningful infomaation regarding the system we're dealing with.
- A proper enumeration procedure will allow our to understand the specific configurations being deployed on the system, and, more inportantly, what are the vulnerable aspects of the system.
- Once we understand the vulnerabilities, we can then exploit them to elevate our privileges.




## The Enumeration Mindset
hink Like a Detective:
- What's here? (Files, users, services)
- What can I access? (Permissions, readable files)
- What's running? (Processes, services)
- What's misconfigured? (SUID, cron, sudo)
- What's vulnerable? (Old software, weak permissions)


## What to Enumerate?
In terms of what to enumerate, the following areas are key points to focus on:
• hardware architecture
• kernel version
• linux distribution + version
• users and groups ()
• access to powerful groups (e.g., , ...)
• sudo configuration ()
• filesystem directories (, , )
• SUID/SGID binaries
• local services
• network interfaces
• software installed with versions
• backups / saved sessions
• repositories under version control systems (, )
• cronjobs (discussed in a later video)
• capabilities (discussed in a later video)








# System Enumeration Methodology




## Systematic Enumeration

### Initial Reconnaissance

#### Get basic system info:

- Current user:
````
whoami
````
<img width="352" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cc498ca-f2ed-4776-b92c-3c087ed8cfb1" />

- USer ID, Group, groups
````
id
````

- System name:
````
hostname
````

- Kernel version, architecture 
````
uname -a
````

- OS version:
````
cat /etc/issue
````

-  Detailed OS info
````
cat /etc/*-release
````


### User & Group Enumeration

#### Current user info
````
id
groups
````


#### All users:
````
cat /etc/passwd
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
getent passwd
````


#### All groups
````
cat /etc/group
getent group
````



#### Last logged in users
````
last
lastlog
````


#### Currently logged in
````
w
who
````


---


### Network Enumeration:

#### Netwrok interface
````
ifconfig
ip addr show
ip route show
````


#### Active connections
````
netstat -antup
ss -tunlp
````


#### ARP table:
````
