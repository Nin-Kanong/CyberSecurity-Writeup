<h1 align="center"> Linux Capabilities Enumeration </h1>







# Introduction

## What is Linux Capabilities?

### The Evolution:
- Old Way: SUID binaries - All or nothing root access
- New Way: Capabilities - Fine-grained privileges


## What are Capabilities?
Capabilities break down root privileges into smaller, specific permissions. Instead of giving a program full root access (SUID), you can grant only the specific privileges it needs.


## Why Capabilities Master for Privileges Escalation:
- More common in modern systems
- Often misconfigured
- Less monitored than SUID binaries
- Can provide root-level access if exploited
- Harder to detect than traditional SUID

# Linux Capabilities Enumeration:


## What are Capabilities in Linux?
### Capabilities Sets
Each process has three capability sets:
- **Inheritable (i)**: Capabilities preserved across execve()
- **Effective (e)**: Currently active capabilities
- **Permitted (p)**: Capabilities that can be made effective
- **Bounding**: Limits what can be added to permitted
- **Ambient**: Inherited across exec calls


## Traditional UNIX vs. Linux Capabilities
- Traditional UNIX:
  - Privileged: euid = 0
  - Unprivileged: euid ≠ 0
- Linux (Kernel ≥ 2.2):
  - Privileges are split into distinct units called capabilities
  - These can be enabled or disabled per thread

**Purpose**: Capabilities implement the least privilege design principle — giving processes only the permissions they need.

- `getcap /usr/bin/ping`: This checks what Linux capabilities are assigned to the ping binary.
- `cap_net_raw`: This capability allows a process to use raw sockets, which are required for sending ICMP packets — the core of what `ping` does.
- `=ep`:
  - `e`: Effective: The capability is active and usable.
  - `p`: Permitted: The process is allowed to use it if needed.
