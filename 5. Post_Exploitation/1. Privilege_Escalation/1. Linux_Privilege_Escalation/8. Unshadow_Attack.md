<h1 align="center"> Unshadow Attack </h1>





## What is Unshadow Attack?
**An unshadow attack** is a technique used during post-exploitation in Linux/Unix systems to crack user passwords by combining two critical files:
- `/etc/passwd`: /etc/passwd: Contains user account information (including usernames and user IDs). Historically stored password hashes here, but modern systems store only placeholder 'x' to indicate that the actual hash is in `/etc/shadow`.
- `/etc/shadow`: Stores the actual password hashes (in a hashed and often salted format) and is readable only by root.


#### The Core Concept:
An Unshadow Attack combines the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files to extract password hashes for cracking.

### Why It Works:
`/etc/passwd`: Contains user info (readable by all)
`/etc/shadow`: Contains password hashes (readable by root only)
When you can read BOTH files, you can extract hashes for cracking



## Understanding Linux Password Storage:
### The Old Way (Less Secure):

- `/etc/passwd`
````
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
````
- `x` means password is in `/etc/shadow`.
- All user info readable by anyone

### The Modern Way (More Secure):
- `/etc/passwd`:
````
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
````

- `/etc/shadow` (root only)
````
root:$6$salt$hashedpassword:19147:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:19147:0:99999:7:::
````




### Shadow File Format:
````
username:$hashing_algorithm$salt$hash:last_changed:min_days:max_days:warn_days:inactive_days:expire_date:reserved
````
- Example Breakdown:
````
alice:$6$somesalt$abcdef123456...:19147:0:99999:7:::
      ^ ^       ^
      | |       |
      | |       └── Hash
      | └── Salt
      └── Hash Type (6 = SHA-512)
````


## Hash Types in Linux:

### Common Hash Algoritms:

| **ID** | **Algorithm**         | **Example Format** |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| **1**  | MD5                   | `$1$salt$hash`     |
| **2a** | Blowfish (bcrypt)     | `$2a$salt$hash`    |
| **5**  | SHA-256               | `$5$salt$hash`     |
| **6**  | SHA-512 (Most Common) | `$6$salt$hash`     |

# Unshadow Methodology:

- So in this I test with my `SSH Server` that i was setup in my docker:
