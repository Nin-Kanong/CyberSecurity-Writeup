## What Are Wildcards?
**Wildcard exploitation**: is a Linux privilege escalation technique that abuses unsafe use of the `*` (wildcard) in commands run with elevated privileges, especially in `sudo` or cron jobs. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious files that match the wildcard pattern


- Wildcards are special characters used to match patterns in filenames. In Linux, the most common wildcards are:
| **Wildcard** | **Meaning**                                            | **Example**                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`          | Matches **any string of characters** (including empty) | `*.txt` → matches all `.txt` files                              |
| `?`          | Matches **any single character**                       | `file?.txt` → matches `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt`                  |
| `[abc]`      | Matches **any ONE character in the set**               | `file[123].txt` → matches `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt` |
| `[!abc]`     | Matches **any ONE character NOT in the set**           | `file[!a].txt` → matches `fileb.txt`, `file1.txt`               |
| `[a-z]`      | Matches **any ONE character in the range**             | `file[a-c].txt` → matches `filea.txt`, `fileb.txt`, `filec.txt` |


## How Wildcard Expansion Works
The Shell Expansion Process:
1. You type: `rm *.txt`
2. Shell expands `*` to match files: `rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`
3. Shell executes: `rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`
