## What is social Engineering?
Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people into doing something that gives an attacker access to information, systems, or physical locations.
- Social engineering = tricking people to give access, information, or perform actions.



## What is Phishing Attack?
Phishing is a form of online fraud in which hackers attempt to get your private information such as passwords, credit cards, or bank account data. This is usually done by sending false emails or messages that appear to be from trusted sources like banks or well-known websites. They aim to convince you so that they can manage to have your information and use it as a fraudster. Always ensure that you are certain about whom you are dealing with before you provide any information.

## hat is a Phishing Attack?
Phishing is another type of cyber attack. Phishing got its name from "phish" meaning fish. It's a common phenomenon to put bait for the fish to get trapped. Similarly, phishing works. It is an unethical way to dupe the user or victim to click on harmful sites. The attacker crafts the harmful site in such a way that the victim feels it to be an authentic site, thus falling prey to it. The most common mode of phishing is by sending spam emails that appear to be authentic and thus, taking away all credentials from the victim. The main motive of the attacker behind phishing is to gain confidential information like:
- Password
- Credit Card details
- Social security numbers
- Date of birth

## Type of Phishing Attacks:
1. Spear Phishing:  
In this method, the attacker targets a particular organization or individual, where the adversary gets the full information of the target and then starts to share malicious emails directly to their inbox to persuade them to share confidential information.

3. Whaling: 
Whaling is a form of spear phishing in which the intended recipient is a senior executive or head of the business, such as the CEO, CFO, or CISO. The attacker creates a phishing email and attempts to exert pressure on the executives so they feel rushed for time and fall for the tactics, exposing sensitive information. 

4. Smishing:  
Smishing operates by sending victims SMS or inviting them to call a number or get in touch with the sender, rather than directly via websites. The victim is then taken to a phishing page, where the remaining stages are followed exactly like in a typical phishing attempt. 

5. Vishing: 
Voice phishing is another name for vishing. By employing contemporary caller ID spoofing, the attacker can persuade the target that the call is coming from a reliable source when they phone them. IVR (Interactive voice response) is another tool used by attackers to thwart law enforcement's efforts to track them down. Credit card / PAN & Aadhar card numbers and other private information are typically taken from the victim using this method.  

6. Clone Phishing:  
In this kind of phishing, the attacker duplicates emails from reliable sources, modifies the content, and adds a link that leads the victim to a phoney or dangerous website. Currently, the attacker sends this email to a broader audience before watching to see who opens the attached file. It propagates among the user's contacts after they click on the attachment which could be malware as well.
