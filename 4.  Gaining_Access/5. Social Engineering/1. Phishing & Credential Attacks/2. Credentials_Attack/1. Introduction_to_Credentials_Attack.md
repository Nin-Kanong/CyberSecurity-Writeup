## What is Credential Harvester?
Credential harvesting is a cyberattack technique where cybercriminals gather user credentials — such as user IDs, email addresses, passwords, and other login information — en masse. The hacker can then use the credentials to access systems and gather data or other sensitive information, sell or share them on the dark web, and/or advance a more sophisticated attack.




Credential Harvesting
Credential harvesting refers to the process by which cyberattackers collect sensitive information, typically usernames, passwords, and other authentication data, from individuals or systems to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, networks, or services. This technique is often leveraged as the initial step of what is ultimately a more complex and egregious, larger-scale cyberattack. Credential harvesting can enable adversaries to obtain initial access, escalate privileges, exfiltrate sensitive data, disrupt systems, or engage in any number of additional malicious activities such as identity theft or financial fraud. Credential harvesting is often carried out via the following techniques:
   - Phishing: The use of phony e-mails designed to look legitimate in order to entice the victim recipientto click a link or open an attachment in the e-mail, which would deliver malicious code to the victim’s system and continue the cyberattack.
   - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: These are any attack where the user’s credentials are captured while they are being transmitted for legitimate purposes as part of a valid login attempt.
   - Keylogging: Malicious software can be deployed by cyberattackers to intercept a victim’s keystrokes. This can include credentials as they are being entered as part of a valid login attempt.
   - Credential Stuffing: Large datasets are frequently leaked, often as a result of a cyberattack. They can be posted for the public to access, or they can be bought and sold on the dark web. When a malicious actor obtains exposed credentials, they will use these same credentials in attempting to compromise another account associated with the same individual. This attack is predicated on the idea that individuals sometimes rely on password re-use, which is the tendency to re-use the same credentials, especially passwords, across many platforms due to the inability to memorize many different paswords. Credential stuffing is the use of compromised credentials associated with an individual to try and compromise other accounts associated with that individual.
   - Social Engineering: This is the use of social manipulation techniques to convince unwitting individuals to reveal their credentials. Malicious actors often attempt to impersonate a help desk empolyee or an authority figure to conduct social engineering.
   - Phony Login Webpages: Also known as pharming, or a watering hole attack, this is a webpage designed to look legitimate, often with a username/password login prompt. When a victim enters their credentials, they are often presented with a message that the site is temporarily down, all while their credentials have been recorded by the threat actor.
   - Malware: This is malicious software that can collect victim credentials and report them back to the threat actor.
