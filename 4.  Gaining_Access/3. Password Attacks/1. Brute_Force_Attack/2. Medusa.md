![0_ETI_tTrASL5HsCwv](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4de03bd-f54d-4af8-ad15-fd1d4e826d07)



## What is Medusa?
Medusa is a parallel, modular, and fast network login brute-forcer that supports many protocols. It's known for its speed and efficiency compared to other tools.


## Key Features:
  - Parallelized attacks - Multiple connections simultaneously
  - Modular design - Supports 30+ protocols via modules
  - Flexible input - Various credential combination methods
  - Resume capability - Can continue interrupted sessions
  - Speed optimized - Generally faster than Hydra


## Medusa vs Hydra:
  - Medusa: Faster, more efficient threading, better for high-speed networks
  - Hydra: More protocols, better community support, more flexible options
    


## Installation & Setup

### Linux Installation
````
sudo apt install medusa
````

- But all in linux maybe already installed.


### Compile from Source
````
git clone https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa
cd medusa
./configure
make
sudo make install
````
- In this i don't show demo cause it already have in my kali.



### Verification

#### Check installation
````
medusa -h
````

### Medusa verbose:

|       `-v` level | What you see (summary)                                                                                                                                                 | Typical use                                                 |
| ---------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-v 0` (default) | Minimal output: only final results and errors.                                                                                                                         | Quick runs when you only want successes.                    |
|           `-v 1` | Basic progress lines: host/task start/finish and summary of found credentials.                                                                                         | General monitoring of job progress.                         |
|           `-v 2` | Per-attempt notifications: each login attempt shown (username/password tried) and simple status (connect/fail/success).                                                | Debugging incorrect user/pass combos or wordlist coverage.  |
|           `-v 3` | More detailed per-attempt responses: shows response codes/messages returned by the target (e.g., auth failed, connection refused).                                     | Diagnose why attempts fail (auth vs connection issues).     |
|           `-v 4` | Protocol-level details: partial request/response snippets, headers (for HTTP modules), and timing info for each attempt.                                               | Deep debugging of HTTP/LDAP/other protocol interactions.    |
|           `-v 5` | Extended debug: internal state, retries, per-socket status, and more verbose timing/tracing.                                                                           | When investigating intermittent or flaky issues.            |
|           `-v 6` | Maximum verbosity: complete low-level debug and dump info (almost everything Medusa knows about the run), including socket connect details and internal decision logs. | Only for deep developer-level troubleshooting — very noisy. |


#### SSH with username and passowrd wordlists:
````
medusa -h 192.168.127.129 -U /usr/share/wordlists/user.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/passwd.txt -M ssh -v 6
