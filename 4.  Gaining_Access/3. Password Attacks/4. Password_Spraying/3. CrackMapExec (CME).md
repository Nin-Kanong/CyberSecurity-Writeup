## What is CrackMapExec (CME)?
CrackMapExec (often abbreviated as CME) is a post-exploitation tool, often described as a "Swiss Army knife" for penetration testing Windows Active Directory environments. It's not just for password spraying (as your file structure suggests); that's just one of its many capabilities.

Its core strength is its ability to leage a set of credentials (a username/password, a password hash, or a Kerberos ticket) across an entire network to see where those credentials have access and then perform a wide variety of actions on the accessible systems.

Key Philosophies of CME:
- Living off the Land: It heavily uses native Windows features and protocols (like SMB, WMI, WinRM, MSSQL) to perform its tasks, making its traffic blend in with normal network activity.
- Network-Wide Execution: You give it a network range and credentials, and it will automatically try to authenticate to every host and execute your command.
- Offensive Swiss Army Knife: It consolidates the functionality of many individual tools into one unified platform.
