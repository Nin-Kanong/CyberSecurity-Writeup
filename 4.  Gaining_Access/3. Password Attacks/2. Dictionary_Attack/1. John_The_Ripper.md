# John The Ripper For Dictionary Attack


## What is a Dictionary Attack?
A dictionary attack uses a pre-compiled list of words (dictionary) to guess passwords. It's the most effective attack method for real-world password cracking.
Why Dictionary Attacks Work:
  - 80% of passwords come from common patterns
  - People reuse passwords across systems
  - Many use simple variations of common words



## RULES-BASED DICTIONARY ATTACKS
Rules mutate wordlist entries to create password variations:
  - `l` = lowercase entire word
  - `u` = uppercase entire word
  - `c` = capitalize first letter
  - `$1` = append "1" to the word
  - `^1` = prepend "1" to the word
