# Introduction 



## Introduction 
“Are you one of them, who thinks that Cross-Site Scripting is just for some errors or pop-ups on the screen?” Yes?? Then today in this ar�cle, you’ll see how an XSS suffering web-page is not only responsible for the defacement of the web-applica�on but also, it could disrupt a visitor’s privacy by sharing the login creden�als or his authen�cated cookies to an atacker without his/her concern. 



## Introduction to Cross-Site Scripting 
Cross-Site Scrip�ng is a client-side code injec�on atack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. In this atack, the users are not directly targeted through a payload, although the atacker shoots the XSS vulnerability by inser�ng a malicious script into a web page that appears to be a genuine part of the website. So, when any user visits that website, the XSS suffering web-page will deliver the malicious JavaScript code directly over to his browser without his knowledge. “XSS” thus has been classified into three main categories: 
 • Stored XSS 
 • Reflected XSS 
 • DOM-based XSS


## Blind XSS 
Many �mes the atacker does not know where the payload will end up and if, or when, it will get executed and even there are �mes when the injected payload is executed in a different environment i.e. either by the administrator or by someone else. So, in order to exploit such vulnerabili�es - He blindly deploys up the series of malicious payloads over onto the web-applica�ons, and thus the applica�on stores them into the database. Thereby, he thus waits, un�l the user pulls the payload out from the database and renders it up into his/her browser.
