# Introduction to SQL Injection


## Introduction 
- Structured Query Language (SQL) has been the standard for handling relational database management systems (DBMS) for years. Since it has become common for internet web applications and SQL databases to be connected, SQL injection attacks of data-driven web apps, also simply called SQLi attacks, have been a serious problem. 
- SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behaviour.
- A SQLi attack happens when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the web app’s SQL implementation by submitting a malicious SQL statement via a fillable field. In other words, the attacker will add code to a field to dump or alter data or access the backend.
- A successful malicious SQL statement could give an attacker administrator access to a database, allowing them to select data such as employee ID/password combinations or customer records, and delete, modify, or data dump anything in the database they choose. The right SQL injection attack can actually allow access to a hosting machine’s operating system and other network resources, depending on the nature of the SQL database. In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks.

## SQL Injection 
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of attack where a malicious actor can manipulate SQL queries within an application to interfere with its database interactions. By inserting (or “injecting”) malicious SQL code into an input field, an attacker can access or modify database data in unauthorized ways, potentially leading to data leaks, unauthorized actions, and other security breaches.


### How SQL Injection Works 
SQL Injection exploits occur when an application improperly sanitizes or validates user input in SQL queries. For instance, if a web application dynamically builds SQL queries using raw user input without adequately handling it, attackers can insert SQL commands that change the behaviour of those queries. Like this:

### Impact of a successful SQL injection attack 
A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as: 
   • Passwords. 
   • Credit card details. 
   • Personal user information. 
SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches over the years. These have caused reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period. 





## SQL injection vulnerabilities 
You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit: 
  • The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies. 
  • Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses. 
  • Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses. 
  • Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond. 
  • OAST (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions. 
Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and 
reliably using Burp Scanner.






## SQL injection in different parts of the query 
- Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection. 
- However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, 
and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection 
arises are: 
  • In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause. 
  • In INSERT statements, within the inserted values. 
  • In SELECT statements, within the table or column name. 
  • In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.




## SQL Injection Attacks 
SQL injection is a common attack vector that allows users with malicious SQL code to access hidden information by manipulating the backend of databases. This data may include sensitive business information, private customer details, or user lists. A successful SQL injection can result in deletion of entire databases, unauthorized use of sensitive data, and unintended granting of administrative rights to a database.  The types of SQL injection attacks vary depending on the kind of database engine. The SQLi attack works on dynamic SQL statements, which are generated at run time using a URI query string or web form.

SQL Injection attacks target applications that rely on unsanitized user inputs in SQL statements. If input validation is weak, the application passes these inputs directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to: 
  • Retrieve sensitive information. 
  • Bypass authentication. 
  • Delete or modify database content. 
  • Execute administrative operations on the database.

Steps in an SQL Injection Attack 
1. Find a Vulnerable Input Field: Attackers look for user input fields, like login forms, search bars, or URL parameters. 
2. Insert Malicious SQL Code: They enter SQL commands within the input field to alter the intended SQL query. 
3. Manipulate SQL Queries: The injected SQL code changes how the database interprets and executes the query. 
4. Obtain Unauthorized Access or Data: Depending on the payload, attackers can view or manipulate database content without authorization. 




## Types of SQL Injection 
There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include: 
  • Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results. OR Also called as Classic or in-band SQLi where Attacker directly alters the SQL query with malicious input. 
  • Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic. 
  • UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables. 
  • Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses. OR Database errors aren't directly shown, so attackers use true/false tests to gather data. 
  • Time-based SQLi: Attackers inject SQL commands to delay responses, determining database information from response times.
