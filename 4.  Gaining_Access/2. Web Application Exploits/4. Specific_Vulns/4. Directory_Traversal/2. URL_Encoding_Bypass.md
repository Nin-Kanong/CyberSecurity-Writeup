# URL Encoding Bypass


## What URL Encoding?
URL encoding (also called percent-encoding) converts special characters into a format that can be transmitted over the internet.


## What is URL Encoding Bypass?
URL Encoding Bypass is a technique where we encode special characters to bypass basic security filters that block patterns like ../ but don't properly decode URLs before checking.


## Common Encodings:
|           Character | URL Encoded | Double Encoded |
| ------------------: | :---------: | :------------: |
| `/` (forward slash) |    `%2f`    |     `%252f`    |
|     `\` (backslash) |    `%5c`    |     `%255c`    |
|           `.` (dot) |    `%2e`    |     `%252e`    |
|       `%` (percent) |    `%25`    |     `%2525`    |
|             (space) |    `%20`    |     `%2520`    |


## How It Works:
Normal path: `../../../etc/passwd`
URL encoded: `..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd`
Double encoded: `..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd`

### Double URL Encoding

### Mixed Case Encoding:
