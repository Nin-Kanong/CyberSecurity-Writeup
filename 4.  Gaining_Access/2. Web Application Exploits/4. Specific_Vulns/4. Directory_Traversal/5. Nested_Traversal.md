# Nested Traversal


## What is Nested Traversal?
Nested Traversal is a technique that uses multiple dots or special sequences that normalize to directory traversal patterns, bypassing filters that look for specific strings like ../ but don't properly handle normalization.


## How Nested Traversal Works
The Core Concept:
  - Filter looks for: ../
  - You send: ....// or ..//
  - After normalization: Becomes ../
  - Bypasses simple string-based filters

## Path Normalization:
````
....//  →  ../
..///   →  ../
....\/  →  ..\  (Windows)
````
