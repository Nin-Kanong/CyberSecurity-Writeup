# Introduction to file upload



What is file upload?

A file upload feature lets users send files (images, documents, archives, etc.) from their browser to a server. Typical uses: profile pictures, document submission, logs, backups, or content management systems.
  - File upload involves:
  - Receiving multipart/form-data requests on the server.
  - Validating the file (type, size, name).
  - Storing the file (filesystem, database, object storage).
  - Serving the file back to users (download or display).
