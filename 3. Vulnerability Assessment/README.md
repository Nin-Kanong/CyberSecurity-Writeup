## ✅ Completed Domains

### 1. Network Vulnerability Assessment
- Conducted live network scans using Nmap (including NSE scripts)
- Performed authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans using Nessus and OpenVAS
- Analyzed findings using CVSS scoring
- Documented risk levels, attack surfaces, and remediation recommendations


### 2. Web Application Vulnerability Assessment
- Performed automated and manual scans using Burp Suite Community and OWASP ZAP
- Identified and validated common web vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Security misconfigurations
- Used SQLMap for controlled exploitation and verification
- Applied Metasploit auxiliary modules for vulnerability validation (non-intrusive)


### 3️ Host-Based Vulnerability Assessment
- Audited Linux systems using Lynis to assess:
  - System hardening
  - Patch status
  - Configuration weaknesses
- Simulated enterprise-style host assessments inspired by Qualys, focusing on:
  - Services exposure
  - User privilege risks
  - Misconfigured permissions

## 🔁 Lab Methodology (Used in All Sections)
Each lab follows a consistent professional format:

> Objective → Tools → Assessment Procedure → Findings → Risk Analysis → Remediation → Lessons Learned

This approach mirrors industry-standard vulnerability assessment and reporting workflows.

### 4. Wireless Vulnerability Assessment — Planned
> This section is intentionally scheduled after completing core networking and web security fundamentals.

### Status
- Current Phase: Theory & protocol study
- Target Start: February 2026
- Expected Completion: Q1 2026


### Planned Toolset
- Aircrack-ng suite
- Kismet
- Wireshark
- Wifite
- Reaver / Bully

📌 All testing will be conducted in controlled lab environments for educational and defensive purposes.
