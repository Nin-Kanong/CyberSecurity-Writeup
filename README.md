## 👤 About Me

I’m **NIN KANONG**, an IT student at **Norton University** in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, with a strong focus on **cybersecurity, network engineering, and ethical hacking**.  

Driven by curiosity and a hands-on mindset, I’ve completed **15+ structured cybersecurity labs** covering vulnerability scanning, traffic analysis, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques. I use **Kali Linux** as my primary OS and am proficient with tools like **Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap, and Nessus**.

I’m especially interested in **financial cybersecurity and digital banking security**, and I aim to apply my technical and analytical skills in a real-world environment where I can grow as a **penetration tester or security analyst**.

Beyond tools, I believe in **clear documentation, structured reporting, and continuous learning** — which is why every lab in this repository follows a professional pentest format:  
**Objective → Tools → Procedure → Results → Lessons Learned → Remediation**.

> 💡 **My philosophy**: *"Security is not a product, but a process."* — Bruce Schneier
