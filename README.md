## 🧭 About This Repository

This repository is my **Cybersecurity Learning Portfolio**, showcasing my progress in:

- 🧠 **Networking & System Fundamentals**  
- 🔍 **Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing**  
- ⚙️ **Scripting, Automation, and Exploitation**  
- 🛡️ **Incident Response & Defensive Techniques**

It reflects my **hands-on practice**, **analytical mindset**, and **commitment to continuous learning** in the field of cybersecurity.

I use this repository as both a personal documentation space and a demonstration of my technical journey.
